But then, the game required an update and it simply would not download. After months of trying to get it to work, uninstalling and trying out various fixed from online forums, nothing gets it to work. I've tried contacting 2k numerous times and I never get a response. Its pretty ridiculous that I bought this game for myself and my friend and I can't even play with him. It's downright disrespectful for the developers to not offer any assistance to get their faulty game to work. I can guarantee you that I'm never going to buy another 2k game if this is the kind of customer support they're touting. It's disgusting that I spent more than 100 dollars on this game and I can't even play it. If you're thinking of purchasing this game or any other 2k game for that matter, don't. This publisher is going to keep spitting in the faces of their customers if you keep purchasing their subpar product. They won't bother offering any assistance until they get hit where it hurts. As long as people keep buying the same recycled garbage every year, then they are perfectly content with screwing over their customers because they know they'll just come crawling back each year."

1089350,0,0,pmesantos,38,6,-1,408,"19 October, 2020","I love basketball, and played when was younger. So decided to buy this game to enjoy and remember those times.The gaming itself is not too bad, enjoyed playing on the beginning, but several things are pretty bad and the game rapidly becomes frustrated to play. Several annoying things.I am 3 seconds on the paint, I get the fault. Some of the AI stays there camping more than 5 seconds without happen anything. Other, the game the opponents transport themselves in front of us. They are at least 2 meters apart next second in front of you or passing into you like you are a ghost. Almost is not worthy block them. Also, sometimes you are far in front of them and seems you hit a wall!The game crashes a bit on transition on the menus. Also, lags on several occasions, like in the when you go to the bench or in the Gym. This last one not showing sometimes the bars or the help we need to finish the exercises. Needed to restart it several times.If you decide not making the Draft and go directly to the NBA, you will struggle a lot to improve your player. I like to play on different positions and need to spend more than 2 hours making the draft for each build. Unacceptable.One of the worst things of the game is the music. Terrible. Some nice songs in the middle but not playing often. Unfortunately, didn't found a way to cancel the music totally like I can do on the FIFA brand. One way is putting the headphones with zero volume when you walk through the Neighbourhood and go trough the menus. Unfortunately need to listen on other sites.Annoying 2KTV transitions making a lot of noise about the new NBA2K21. Really annoying.Other thing I noticed are the subliminal messages on the background and the politicised way of the game. Career story is full of them.Can accept a lot of things but not politics in a sports simulator game. Any kind of political influence.  Noticed this happens on some new games lately. This becoming a bit like braining wash for all king of political sides. It's really shames this happens.So, even I like a lot basketball side and the gameplay itself is not bad, not buying new versions of this game. Unfortunately, there is no other Basketball option for PC."

Watch as your team mates fail to convert the easiest of free looks, or inexplicably decide to drive to the basket only to get blocked repeatedly by any of the Lakers in the same half of the court as them. Davis is basically the shot stopping equivalent of Mr Tickle. At the other end, things aren't much better, if they aren't launching a barrage of undefendable Oops, they're throwing up contested, off balance shots that seem to defy gravity to hang on the rim before eventually dropping in.Against other teams, you'll probably have some fun. Giannis is basically a demigod but at least the rest of the team have some weaknesses. A bit more of a tutorial would be nice, they teach you how to shoot and pass but most of the other controls seem hidden until you delve into it. It's the best basketball game out there by default and enjoyable to make your own player and train him up through his Rookie years, just whatever you do, sim the games against the Lakers."

What I liked the most is that now we have a visual clue when the ball is less protected and we can steal it without fouling. Also, in MyCareer you can choose what badges you'd like to unlock after you've gathered enough points to earn one. And there's the addition of the WNBA _ but since I only play MyCareer and MyGM, I probably won't play with/against those teams, so for me it's a useless change, although a welcome one. The worst is the lack of good stories in the offline modes. The prelude to MyCareer is short and bland, despite a good performance by Idris Elba; in 2K19, there were more characters and way more drama _ now, we've barely any journey. Also, in 2K19 MyGM had a long and also dramatic story, and now there's none! And we could create a team from scratch (I'll miss the Bronx Hard Ones, with Pickle Rick as logo); now you have to choose from one of the real-world franchises. Boring.  It's also weird that we get accolades notifications during the games, but they're nowhere to be seen afterwards. I only recommend this during this deep sale, if, like me, you don't care about playing online, you're sick of 2K19 and you're not interested in 2K21 (maybe I'll get it a year from now, if it costs the same as a subway round trip; otherwise, I'll have pizza)."

I know badges play a role in game but at a 90+ shooting in all three ranges i should not be missing wide open shots. 6 games in and I'm over it. 2K should take the $10 I spent and give it to the devs to pay them to actually play this game and fix their flaws.

1089350,2,0,ArteFlamel,259,39,-1,69.2,"20 August, 2020","I bought this at the 90% off sale time but do not let that fool you this game will cost you quite a bit more and it will all be in vain.Graphics - It is a one year old game which looks okay at ultra. As a PC player expect Console quality graphics.Music - I am not a fan of these tracks but some of them are decent and none of them are too bad.Controls - The controls may not be the worst part about this game but they are horrible. I use a wireless Xbox One controller but I've tried wired as well and it will always feel like your playing truck simulator rather than in the NBA. I could understand the tilting and skidding and floating if it was at least realistic. The AI defense simply floats around blocking your every attempt to get in. They have some kind of speed boost making your defending trash against them.Fun - No this is a nice game that becomes tedious when you realize there is a business model to why your character is so trash.  I recognized it because I've played a lot of MMORPGs so it's familiar. Your character has semi hidden stats that level up over time. You also have the obvious stats that you can pay real money to increase. I spent $30 on this game total and got through the my career portion of the game despite some of the retarded work out mini-games.  When you get to the NBA those hidden stats become so damn pronounced with every even Centers running circles around you. What's more the hidden attributes of the AI forces you to miss shots even if they are 6ft away from you because they have intimidater. Breaking the AI ankles even with 75 handling, 50 lateral movement and 80 post movement is impossible with the hidden stats being considered. It isn't that the AI is that good, it's just that your character rolls like they had hip replacement surgery this morning.  Couple that with that everyone simply goes faster than you and you have people who are past the half court catching up to you on the paint before you can complete a half roll to lay up.These hidden stats makes for the experience as a player totally new to NBA 2k completely unfun and more frustrating than anything else. It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the obvious buy gold coins options to make your character stronger option at the upgrade screen.Conclusion - If you are new to 2k like I am I cannot recommend this game even at the 90% off rate. This is not the sport game for you - there is no tutorial mode or any hand holding even on rookie difficulty. If that's your jam then good luck - the reward of winning a game isn't even there because I gain 5% or less xp per game as I can't make 3's, can't make inside shots, can't dribble, can't pass correctly 5v5 (Whole other issue here), can't defend, and can't have fun. Perspective - I am coming at this game for the experience of playing a NBA game and being a player - it's more like an RPG for me, what I got is something that takes itself FAR too seriously as a tournament game and is built assuming you mean to play it competitively.  I have no intention of playing online or going against other people. Because of that this game is not for me."

I haven't played the Team mode or anything else yet, so i won't be reviewing it.Pros-It controls very similarly to 2k19(atleast with a controller)-The customization has increased with the new mybuild system-It feels like you get more VC in the story( i was on pro and was getting 600-700 vc per story mission)Neutral-The myplayer story is very short.(beat it in less than 9 hours)-The achievements can only be unlocked after beating the story(which isn't so bad i guess due to it being short).Cons-The cutscenes so far can be very long(one of the first ones was 12 minutes).-The potential system or whatever it's called makes it so if you didn't set your potential for certain attributes, then you can't increase them at all-The graphics really didn't improve much-It took a while to actually get a decent FPS, i had to switch graphics cards and change my computers mode to high performance to get 60 FPS on ultra(which i dont usually have to do).-Hacking is very easy to do it seems. I've ran into several people that were hacking(some had stretched bodies which was funny), only experienced this in mypark though.I'd say the game is worth it for $4.80, considering 2k19 is going to be dead soon.

I am rather shocked by the normalisation of gambling in a sports game. From fortune wheels to loot boxes and the constant need for VC. Then there technical issues as well. Apparently, the game is so capitalistic american, that it constantly changes the settings back to the imperial system. Every f*cking time. You can never be sure if something is saved. Then there are constant connection issues and the drills don't work as well. So is it better than 2k18? Yes. But is Human centipede better than Human centipede III?

You either pay to win or you grind for hours (like 100+ hours) and then you win.But now I finally got relatively good at it and started wining, and found out the flaw I can't forgive. It is scripted AF. I'm playing with Bucks, season is going well, 52-9. Only now I realize that those 9 loses came from teams that are considered strong stat-wise - Lakers, Clippers, GSW etc. meaning those loses were scripted. I've come to realize it after a loss we just had from Lakers.We were playing hard and I was working my arse off, but we lost.I'm having 32 points, 9 assists season on average. This game I had A+ rating 61 points and 12 assists. 61-12... I even had 8 rebounds which I simply never doAnd we lost 126-159...Danny Green hit 4 threes in a row only in first quarterDwight Howard had 19 point game and he hit ALL his free throwsAntetokounmpo had 20 points... while he averaged 34 in seasonAnd most importantly I'm a 3 point sharpshooter with 99 points in 3-pt stat (I've got 48% 3PT% on average), I have won 3 point contest and this game I hit 9-25 threes and realized that game just won't give them to me, as my team is scripted to lose...126-159!"

It's obvious 2K has switched their focus to the neighborhood and the gamemodes that are riddled with microtranscations. Even with sliders the MyGM mode is as barren as the Sahara desert. No narratives, practice is useless, mentoring is useless. And no matter what every player wants to leave even if you are first seeded and win the championship. And even if a person wants to come back in FA guess what? Its impossible to sign them for a long term contract because of the bug with qualifying offers. Complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.And don't get me started on the gameplay (with the help of online ""realistic"" sliders). Players sliding on defense to make way for the offense is very apparent. Rebounds are totally scripted from the time the ball leaves a players hand. Mid game adjustments make absolutely no sense.

1089350,1,0,7.65612E+16,56,5,-1,23.1,"11 August, 2020","First time playing a 2K game since the 17 release and honestly, it's pretty badIt's sad to see that the graphics are the only improvements I see that they have made over the past years. Buying an annual sports game release and only seeing better lighting and a roster update is a slap in the face for the fans. Gameplay is horrendous. At moments shooting is smooth but then at other times shooting almost a perfect shot would miss no matter how close you are, whether or not you are being covered by an opponent. Passing the ball as well can be confusing at times as well. I'll try to pass to my teammates and it'll either pass to someone that i don't want to have the ball, or they just straight up don't pass. Defense although just as terrible, I don't have much of a problem with because it's at the very least somewhat consistent. Besides exhibition games and occasional multiplayer against friends, the only other mode I tried getting into was MyCareer. MyCareer in my eyes is a failed attempt at trying to be something they aren't. I get that they want to make it seem more personal, and although I haven't seen or played past MyCareer modes, they have to trash the story aspect. It's so awkward to make a player that looks like you, give them a name, then be thrown into some god awful story plot that came from High School Musical with the dude that physically looks like the player you made, but now they gave him a voice that makes me sound like I'm 20 skin tones darker (I'm a vary pale man), the announcers don't even say the name I gave my player and default to the story name, and now the personality your ""new"" player has doesn't even match what you were going for. And if they want to stay on this route, can the voice actor playing us not be awful? In fact, a lot of the voice actors are pretty bad. It would be so much tolerable to play if they had a good story and better actors and writers.I have done my best to avoid multiplayer (MyTeam) due to all of the push back it got from fans and critics. If you want to see what multiplayer is like then just search it up.2K use to be a well respected company and people are willing to give them a chance to regain that respect but their greed is what moves the company now. The fact that they still are selling 2K17 for $60 tells you enough about what they care for more. I only bought this game for $8 on sale and I'm still unsure of whether I made the right choice to buy this. In conclusion, look for alternatives before you consider buying another 2K game."

Iâ€™ve always and only bought 2K for casual exhibition games and MyGM playthroughs and never really dug into MyCareer. I decided to go and really do it this year. I didnâ€™t really hate the grind that much because I personally enjoy doing so and I thought it was fast enough to at least get to 85~90 without spending a single dime plus getting your badges up and running early is fairly manageable to me. But for most people who canâ€™t spend 100+ hours in games, I can definitely see why it still feels like a legit grind. What I find ridiculous is that it has the greediest microtransaction system in any online game Iâ€™ve messed around with and it has been a horrible cycle of deliberate money-grabbing each year! I havenâ€™t even touched MyTeam. The fact that they always price 2K games at a full AAA tag like they are actual new games, which clearly are not, and still has this much â€˜Casinoâ€™ inside is just straight up BS. Everything that makes any game enjoyable deserves praise, but this has been a blatant cash grab for multiple years now. I wonâ€™t talk about the good stuff and Iâ€™m giving it a negative feedback just to be on the player-baseâ€™s side who are clearly being milked for a long time already, with zero regard towards its loyalty. Easily one of the hungriest publishers of the last few years. This could be my last 2K game if they continue to push this predatory business model."

I dont understand how you people can sleep at night knowing that you are preying on fans young and old with your microtransactions. You already charge 65 dollars for an unfinished, copy and paste game, yet you still force us to pay at least 100 dollar more just to make our character playable. Add another 100 if we want to wear something else besides that s****y brown shirt. For alot of people in this world, making video games is a dream come true. When I think about 2K after what you guys did to Bioshock and NBA, you should be ashamed what you have done to this industry. i know you guys will never read this comment or care, but you better pray there isnt a god, because the s*itstorm that is coming for you cant be ignored.

1089350,12,6,OddIy,31,6,1,140.4,"4 August, 2020","2K is known to be money grabbers, and that's no exception with NBA 2K20. MyCareer and MyTeam are littered with microtransactions that make the game pay to win, so it's no wonder people hack to make their guys have slenderman arms and 1 inch tall. Advertisements are plastered all over the game, whether it's in MyCareer or even in the loading screens. MyTeam by around January and Feburary becomes stale when they start pumping out Galaxy Opal players like it's candy. HOWEVER, there's something to be said about the presentation and the best game mode in the NBA 2K series, MyLeague. When 2K tries, it can produce amazing results. There are locker room cutscenes, interviews with players and coaches and our favorite broadcasters Shaq, Kenny and Ernie. MyCareer has hours of brilliantly animated cutscenes and voice acting, which is definitely an improvement from the atrocious voice lines from NBA 2K15 that sounded like they were reading a book out loud in English class. The cyberfaces, while not the best on some players like 2010's Kobe and rookie LeBron, are very accurate and detailed. There's tons of replayability in MyLeague. Take someone from the 90's and see how they would play in the modern NBA, remove everyone who makes the All-NBA each season and see how terrible the league gets, put in your 99 overall created player and watch him break all of the records, whatever. There's so many possibilities in MyLeague and tons of outcomes for you to observe. Plus the simulation speed is way faster than on console. Player and team's stats are in-depth and advanced, which is a refresher from most sports games like modern Madden games who have basic stats. You have to think about what kind of impact each move makes, from releasing a player to signing a team owner.NBA 2K20 isn't really a game for your casual NBA fan and more suited to hardcore NBA fans (or kids who wanna flex on the park with the VC they bought from their mom's credit card)"

Some games will make you actually watch the AI and skip hitting the skip button -- if you're into it.But it feels clunky. Animations are long and will prevent you from performing your ideas on court. At the beginning of your career, your Turnover PG will be an abomination to look at and you won't understand why your character is not jumping to block the shots, properly. That's supposed to be the sense of progression. So, you're an NBA player with no know-how to block a shot or steal a ball, but your stat increases will magically grant you that intuition. Rebounds... oh, that's a long topic, but let's say if you want a challenge and you choose Hall of Fame difficulty, and you also play anything else than a 4 or a 5, you will have games with 0 rebounds with maximum effort.You find your character committing court violation, while you were pulling the analog ""away"" from the line. You see your teammate leading the fast break, followed by your lob, only to see the ball flying through his hands, into an innocent bystanders head (which aren't very animate anyway). You see your 7'1"" #5 not being able to box out the opposing #1 or protect the rim, while if he's a star player he'll usually grab ORBDs and dunk it.I got drafted by Bulls in my first MyCareer attempt and thought it was the team. So, I traded. Still the same issues. The problem is, as you raise the AI difficulty, that doesn't affect your teammates. And it creates some disgusting scenes. They will still fail to find the open man, or grab boards, sometimes even nail open shots.The progression system feels like an endless grind and you do not dare start a new career, unless you're a vivid NBA 2K player. The badge system sounds amazing but you find yourself spending copper badges on half of them, because they sound like the stuff to make a solid NBA player, but it poorly reflects the game and feels very algorithmy.I hope to see the KB24 covered NBA 2K21 to be better than this, as I've been playing this series for many years now and would be thrilled to see it flourish and improve. After watching ""The Last Dance"", the game felt even more clunky, and it was a ""tearing up"" moment."

Everyone moves with slowmotion, time speed goes slower and slower, after that simulation is completed.- MyNeighbourhood is full of cheaters. Some players builds characters that has arms longer than their body. Their elbows are touching the ground and it is stupid as hell.- Story was really good and I liked it so much.

The game is set up so you either grind 1000 miserable hours or spend 1000 dollars. Ronnie2k made a lot of late development promises that were not kept. It has the exact same park as last year and the movement of the players is way more jittery but you get used to it. I can not believe this is the final production game. The desktop logo when this game first came out was the 2k19 logo which is hilarious because this is just that game but worse.

I'm just so glad that this 'review' got such a reach and I very much hope that at least few people didn't buy this garbage because of it.26.10.2020: After playing Madden NFL 2020 for some time, I stand corrected.

I don't know if I'm the minority here, but I don't want to grind a ridiculous amount of hours to pull my player out of the depths of mediocrity. I then play through the entire playoffs and carried the Blazers to a title while averaging 50+ points through the playoffs (my highest scoring game being an 88 point tripple double). Did I get any extra VC for this at any time? Lol naahhhhhh. Instead I got a sound bug that made it so I couldn't even half enjoy the awkward ass cut scenes after winning the finals. Oh that reminds me, I L O V E all of awkward silences in every cut scene, not to mention the post game show interviews are cringey as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. At the end of all this I just wanted to do what I've always done: go to the past champions page and see my team named as the champions for the 2019-2020 season and my name for the finals MVP next to it...but of course they...removed it???? Honestly it seems like the devs are so out of touch. Everything feels so half assed and they've actually removed a ton of single player features from previous games. Of course, it seems like they are more focused on the furthering the competitive multiplayer scene, which I can understand at this point. But at the same time they seem to have no problem with blatantly neglecting the players who only want a single player experience out of this game. This will be the last 2k I purchase. Time to go back to the good ol days of 2k10 when I could make my player a 7'10 freak of nature through hex edit and just have fun without being spammed by 2k2v and ads every other step I reluctantly take through the neighborhood that I'm forced to be in.Goodbye 2k, and don't forget to shove it up your greedy asses."

Other game modes like ''The Cage"" are dead. Decent MyCareer story, the options you have to take during interviews/dialogues are either corky or team praising oriented. I have mixed feelings about MyCareer mode, it could've been so much better, I'm not asking for a Witcher 3 dialogue menu, but still... the options you're taking doesn't affect your story at all. It's an unrealistic linear story and that's it. Also, there is no option to play as a female character in MyCareer mode. They could at least add the option (even without a story) to play as a female.

The problem is online is literally FLOODED with cheaters, everyones a 95 legend with boosted stats but you inspect their cards and they are 80's. You have players walking around with 9ft wingspans so you literally can never get a rebound or shoot. There's no way to report these players or anything so you're just left to deal with it, 2k21 needs to have anti cheat before it ends up being the same trash. Other than the cheaters this game is great"

While i usually only play these yearly releases for the single player MYCareer, ever since they added the neighborhood i loved playing that as well, but this game RUINED it by allowing people to pop up with 10 foot wingspans and arms that literally go through the floor, making it a joke to play against them. Items in the store are ridiculously priced. A pair of shorts can run you as much as 15,000 VC. 15,0000!!!!!!! A skateboard or any mode of transportation to get around the neighborhood faster than the regular speed of molasses going uphill? Oh thats not too expensive, just a cool 30,000 VC or more. Daily Spin? useless as well as everybody and their momma caring about what your ranking and all your stats are before deciding if youre even worth joining for a casual 3 on 3. So if your character is rated anything from 60-89 good luck getting people to join your team or squad up unless youre playing with friendsConstant camera glitches in the barbershop and at the beginning of NBA games"
1089350,0,0,7.65612E+16,305,20,1,278.6,"25 July, 2020","I find it pretty funny how many people wrote negative reviews saying how it was the worst game and waste of time ever.... then you look at the hours... and they keep playing it more and more... dudes be writing its ""worst game ever"" and then play 40 more hours after the review, or the complaints its not worth $15 after playing 70+ hours in less then a month.If you do play it, check out the WNBA part, it actually is pretty cool, and check out one of their games on TV or in person its become a pretty exciting league. Game feels a lot like a slow progression over the last few years, I usually play these on console, but the PC ports are getting better and better (except for cheaters are more common on PC but that is every game right?). I think its the best version yet, the story not so much, its unique and interesting but eh... what do you expect right? so its ok. The game play though I think is getting better, I felt the shooting is getting better, the movements feel better then previous years(once you learn them). While trying to get better the game does make things worse; stats/badges are more important then ever, height is more important(physics of game blocking and covering %), learning plays, animations can make things impossible to counter or stop. You just have to except the limitations of the game and what they are, and that is where at times it becomes thrustrating, how many players know they can turn off the shot meter and release it based on the animation and get a increase to the shot %? Because the game is RNG and everything is % based, which means yes the perfect shot can miss, the worst can go in... playing better and having better cards just increases those %. The microtransactions? yeah its in your face... spending money will make it easier, but you can easily play without spending a dime again, it can all be earned slowly, but still sucks. The less offline stuff you do the less its a issue, multiplayer obviously is impacted a lot by $$$$... so it is what it is. I don't think its the worst game out there in that regard, but it is pretty bad, I think madden and some of MMO titles out there are worse. That said it doesnt bother me in this one. Anyway core game is a small but nice step over previous years, lot of things to do, huge game, lot of challenges, but in the end plagued with predatory microtransactions, so your mileage may vary, but you can indeed play single player without it impacting you much at all."

It took the focus off of becoming the best all around player you were capable of creating and investing time into and turned it into a game of numbers, numbers that had to be balanced because 2K's focus for not only MyCAREER but for every game mode is the online play. They have to 'balance' the players you'll be matching up against in the park so you can't just play by yourself and have a guy who can hit threes and take it to the rack. Even though these players exist and have existed in the NBA since time immemorial, it's now almost an impossibility due to the allotment of attributes. I will admit this is the best approach they've taken since MyPARK was introduced, but it's still limiting and frustrating as a dude who wants no part of online play. Also it crashes all the time at the very end of MyCAREER games and makes you play the entire game again. 0/10, load up 2k13 on your PS3 if you want a fun MyPLAYER experience."

Same goes for Klay. They instantly get the ball and toss up some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that will never go in. There is this dumbass animation this year where ball goes in almost down to the net and then rims out. It happens like 10 times a game. I tried playing on HoF, Superstar, Allstar. The same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.Enemy CANT PROTECT THE PAINT AT ALL. I can have 100% FG. They dont protect the paint at all, but trying to get a 3 is insanely hard, they protect it like their life depends on it, speedboosting doing glitchy animations just to stick to you.Also the game has CONSTANT Crash To Desktop for example when viewing roster in My League.I only paid 7eur for this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and I feel like I got scammed. 2k19 is a better game IN EVERY WAY.

The dislike I have towards the game is the server problems and that the game is very much based on VC or micro transactions. Also even though this game is meant for controller the PC/keyboard controls are horrid and it doesn't even respond to some inputs like I can't even play MyLeague without a controller cause the start button is not responsive even if I change the binding. Though tbh playing 2K with keyboard is clown af. Though the offline play is amazing. If you want to play multiplayer you should play a different game

I know what I was doing when I bought it, and a knew it'd be practically the same game as 2k19. If that fact bothers you, I don't recommend this game, but I have dumped 102 hours into it (Mostly MyCareer) and I regret none of it. I will say, however, that MyCareer is  ALMOST pay to win. I've grinded to 85 OV but it did take around 90 hours of play because the higher your OV the longer it takes to get to the next level. It also doesn't help that skills also rise MAJORLY in price after a while (Like OV 70). I don't really play much other than MyCareer but I do play MyGM which is a whole 'nother thing entirely, but it's practically the same as 2k19 and 2k18.

The gameplay is fun and deep, but also suffers from glitches and bugs like people teleporting through each other, stats getting misrecorded, and some stutters.

U can upgrade your man you can go to they gym you can go play street ball. You can do anything you want its like your really in the nba, Now the best thing is that you can play with others that have this game. I wish you could play with your xbox friends and PS4 friends but sadly this is a pc only game. You can use KAM but i use controller which is much better i would recommend useing a controller it helps  with movement. Honestly the only down part is the cost it costs way to much."

1089350,1,0,fruitdragon,132,7,-1,67.8,"18 July, 2020","Once the excitement wears off and the gloss fades, this game is very, very poorly made, and was designed so to scam dumb kids and unfortunately, dumb adults, to continuously feed Take-Two even more money than the literal billions in copy sales they already had. Why a business tactic that is designed to hurt the consumer works, I don't know, but what I do know is that this game, and this franchise as of late, is not good at all. Sure, it can be fun, especially when you're playing with someone else, but that's primarily because you're playing the game because you like basketball and there aren't other NBA basketball competitors out there. With that being said, that is why I continue to play - there aren't any other basketball/NBA games with a community this size, and because during a time with no basketball or other sports, it fills a void, and thus, I am addicted to even the slightest drip of NBA content. Although MyTeam is no longer fun to me, and MyCareer is exciting only half of the time, the game can keep you interested with MyLeague - the only reason I really still play. And, if you want to pay that price tag for BasketballGM with better graphics, go for it. But even MyLeague is annoying. This may be a jumbled mess of my ramblings, but overall, I would say you're better off not buying this game and supporting this company. If you do, don't buy it from an official retailer. For now, I cannot recommend this game, and hopefully, that'll change with other entries, but I don't think it will.TL;DR: Constant crashes, horrible AI, bad animations (everything movement in the game is animation based, and of course, every animation is too long and not user friendly), bad Virtual Currency system (game is near unplayable for your MyCareer character if you don't buy VC for him), and even more. This game is just bad."

I was really weary about buying this because all of the negative comments in here, but, as a newcomer to the series and a BIG RPG fan, I'm quite enjoying the ""MyCareer"" mode. I actually cared about what happens with the characters and felt quite connected to the team. Still getting used to the controls (only 5 hours in at the time of this posting), but playing the Career mode is actually teaching me how to play properly and went from a D- player to a B+ by the end of the draft (remember, I'm a newcomer so go easy on me).I was also weary on buying because many people talked about it being glitchy, but I haven't found any so far and have always had a steady frame rate.TLDR: If you're like me and this is your first NBA2K game, go for it, (wait for a sale if you want) just remember that most of the reviews are from people that have bought past titles and are comparing them (not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just that it's not relevant to someone who hasn't played the other ones)"

It's too bad because there are areas of improvement but the layup mechanics on this game is completely broken to be almost unplayable. I cannot recommend this game to anyone no matter the price. It's ok at 85% off. But can't stand how even the best big men miss easy lay ups and gimme's near the post whenever someone's nearby even when they are not actively defending. Doesn't matter whether I'm controlling the player or not. Never had instances like this in previous 2K. They are also trying to forcefeed you those Neighborhood Streetball stuff down your throat with MyRep and ""rewards"" that come with it in My Career. Those ""rewards"" used to be available just playing through My Career without Street ball nonsense. Not really interested. But at 85% off, it's tolerable."

1089350,0,0,946juanito,33,1,-1,331,"16 July, 2020","The lack of competition with other basketball games made 2K too comfortable and rest on their past successes.- MyCareer mode is still ok, but the story is not interesting nor decent, like every single edition.- Parks and other Online game modes have lag, delay, server connection problems, overall the online experience is bad, the community is toxic, so those game modes have no purpose if you don't have a squad.- Ultimate Team is solid, challenges are good, not too deversified but I guess 2K couldn't think out of the box for this one.The main problems with this game in my opinion are the AI and the animations. Team mates don't execute plays, centers with no 3pt shot stay in corners, others are missing a lot of WIDE open shots. Screens don't trigger / animate like they should, opponents go through the screen as soon as it is set. And i'm not even bringing up the times the ball goes through hands, arms, heads, with no change in trajectory, the times you dive for a loose ball, grab the ball and then slide out of bounds, the reach-ins that either immediatly fouls the opponent or just does nothing to bother him. The times you have a clear path to the hoop on a fast break or penetration and your player just trigers a pullup in the paint instead of a lay up or dunk.A lot of small glitches and bugs that could improve the game drasticly in my opinion. It's in the quality of the details that you can really see how good something is. NBA 2K20 is not one of those things, especially if you consider it's basicly the same game every years sinds new gen consoles.Good overall game but way too overpriced for what it actually is. 2K has been recycling their game for over 3-4 years now, so there is no way this should be 60-70 bucks each year.Ps: BTW, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 2K for always giving no â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about the PC community and always giving us a worse version of the game compared to consoles. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ them and Ronny for false advertising the park and other features of their game. I paid 13 bucks for this game and won't ever pay more than 15 bucks for a game that is filled with micro-transactions, pay-to-win mentality, bad servers, no â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ given about the feedback of 2k players / community."

Players missing easy under the basket shots, making awkward shots and missed when they are only 3 feet away from the open basket. Towards the end of the game I'm down 2 points and somehow I got a chance to create an open lane for T.Harris to drive to the open basket without anyone near him, and then I pushed R stick towards the basket, and the weird thing happened. Harris made a fake shot and then turned around doing nothing, and then the defenders caught him up and he missed the shot. Stuff like this will never happen in reality. It's just so stupid."

Career is fine if you want to sit back and have zero challenge but for those who like to play with other people, don't even bother. 2K has consistently refused to do anything about the prolific cheater situation in park games and as a result the multiplayer is a complete joke. You will be hard pressed to find a single park game that doesn't contain someone who has hacked their character in one way or another and it absolutely kills the game. It's become clear that the PC is an afterthought and nothing more than way to squeeze out what little more money they can from microtransactions.

And after slogging through the process of getting my player in 2k19 to be one of the best I simply did not want to go through the long slog again on a bad team with a bad player and play 200+ games just to get them to where I am now.  Now if we could import from existing games to the new game...that would be cool."

I've been playing 2k since 2k13 and I've gotten almost every game after that one since. With that being said, this really is just 2k18 with current rosters. MyCareer is good, but definitley could've been better. MyCourt has been the exact same for 3 years now. The neighborhood essentially the same as the previous 2 games except for the fact that there's no arcade and no dunk off. Do I miss those things? Not really. For the amount of money I paid for this game, I like it. If you told me i needed to pay another 60 bucks for the same game I got 3 years ago with a different title and cover, I'd probably be playing something else by the time you said 60. If 2k21 is similar to this game, I'd be surprised it anyone gets it for more than 30 dollars. If you have 2k18 or 2k19, you'll probably gt this game anyways because you were dedicated enough to get 19 knowing it was a clone of 18 but hey, I warned you."

Just pay 100 extra bucks and boost your guy.And then all the presentation. I keep mashing my A button for 2 minutes straight before a game starts. All that presentation nobody cares about anymore. This BB game makes it very hard to get some good BB minutes in. Every few seconds there is some f...ing presentation you try to click away.The freeking game didn't even show me my draft?!?

It's more of mediocre and I don't really care for it as much as MyTeam. Overall it's a solid 3/5 for me, I would still recommend that you pick this game up if it's on a huge sale like last summer.I'm looking forward to NBA 2k21 -- hopefully latency issues are fixed for online play and the 3/5 will definitely go up to 5/5"

Save all the money on the above and improve the gameplay and AI, game needs to feel more realistic on the basketball plays side, execution of shots and movements are realistic, but as a whole it doesn't give you a different experience than any other previous game of the series. We are in 2020, I think we can do better beyond the excellent graphics, get that AI smarter and capture better the essence of basketball.2K needs to stop developing a game every year and start actually taking a look at the core of the gameplay in the long term. Otherwise is a reskinned game every year with extra content that keeps growing and just adds stuff that doesn't bring any value to the actual basketball gameplay."

You either have no sound at all our your sound settings change by itself w/o a certain pattern. 2kTV sound can't be adapted. I wish they would just hire a sound engineer to fix these problems.Something similar to the sound problem is the stick setting which decides on its own to change. This is also an issue with the 3-4-5 many different options. Normally you would put a general options setting in the interface but this game has different option settings in each different layout.

This game is beyond grindy and controls feel like there's a significant input lag when pressing buttons on my controller connected via usb. online requires me to unplug my mouse, keyboard, and keypad because there's no option in the game to switch inputs on the fly leading to a loss because I cannot move my MC on the court in neighborhood. Regarding the grind, it is insane how tedious it is to earn VC. It would've been fine if VC was used for cosmetics and the gambling aspects of the game, however it is also tied into character progression leaving you with a tough decision whether you want your character to ""git gud"" or not look broke as hell with the default clothes or even paying for the gambling to get better cards for myteam. The game constantly nudges you to pay for more VC which they constantly add the button to purchase VC when you're using VC to buy stuff. One of the most egregious moves 2K has implemented is to move MyCareer to online only, and it wasn't an accident. 2k knew the best way to entice players to pay for microtransactions is to make it online and have other players show off the cool and expensive items they've bought for their characters. You're not just worrying about how your character performs now, you're worried how your character looks to other players. For evidence, look no further than the 2k Neighborhood, where all the shops, gym, and training center are. In order to utilize those amenities, you must navigate yourself through the neighborhood, and walk by other players who look better than you in order to reach which ever facility you intend to visit. Sure you can try to avoid the neighborhood, however it is near impossible since you need to visit the shoe store for some shoe deals in mycareer, as well as the training facility where you can boost your stats by playing a couple of bad mini games.So, let's talk about in game advertisements. Product placements are everywhere in this game, and when I say ""everywhere"" I really mean EVERYWHERE to the point where in a cutscene in mycareer you meet a representative for beats to which he asks the player to plug in beats in an interview. 2K was not subtle on the beats plug in, this game just advertised to me about certain beats headphones with active noise cancelling, to which I argue that my Sony WH-1000XM2s are just good enough for me with their amazing active noise cancelling which helps get me through this game, plus the Sony WH-1000XM2s has an ambient noise option which allows sounds from outside the headphones to pass through so you can hear and pay attention to your surroundings.(now wasn't that a good product placement? lol) This game is just a gargantuan advertisement that YOU PAY FOR. You are paying to get served advertisements, period."

Not only will your team mates NOT pass you the ball when you call for it, the game will actually penalize you for asking for the ball....in a game where the grind to improve your character is Korean MMO levels of stupid.Klunky, sloppy, pigs on ice handling, and riddled with horrible design choices.You come out of college as a first round draft pick.....who's stats are all 40 points lower than anyone you'll be playing!!!!!  Thanks for putting me up against that shooting guard, with 91 speed, and then taking points AWAY from me because I couldn't cover him.  It's just beyond stupid game design, to the point of infuriating.To add insult to injury, in no particular order:Career mode:  Doing pretty well?  Time to end that.  There is a script in place for career mode, and you WILL follow it.  Doing too well?  Time to make you suck for a few games.  Yah, the Lakers shot 36%, and James missed 4 free throws in a row down the stretch.  Your usual 35 points a game ya...well...you got 9 this time, sorry.Being benched when winning:  Same as above...doing too well?   You clawed your way back to a 4 point lead?....time to sit on the bench, when you come back, there will be 4 seconds left, and you're down by 20.Predatory gaming at it's worst:  The INSANE badge and exp grind is such an obvious pay to play grab, in a full priced game, it's beyond shameful.  This pay to win is worse than most F2P games I've played.I put some time into this game, because I missed my refund window, covid, and because there are parts of the game that are great.  The character creation and development COULD be amazing, if it wasn't tied to such a horrible and infuriating mess of a money grab, coupled with heavy handed AI and scripted outcomes.This game would be so much fun if it encouraged rerolling and playing different characters, and if the players actions actually mattered in the outcome of anything.  As it stands, it's one of the most frustrating games I've ever played.  The idea of playing multiple builds with the level of grind it takes for a character is just.....beyond bad game design.  They have missed every single good point about this game, and actively destroyed them along the way to money grab heaven.This is one of those games that is especially rage worthy, because it had the bones to be amazing and not only squandered them, but took a giant dump on them."

This is my second 2k and it shows how little they care about the game. First of all this isn't nba 2k20 it's nba 2k19.2. Everything is basically  the same as 2k19. Mycarrer: The storyline is far less cringe than 2k19 and the new way to build your myplayer was a good new edit and that's pretty much the positiv. The negative on the other hand â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.. The first seasone is just a long seasone of 2k trying to get you to buy VC. It's absolutely ridiculous how a player that's drafted into the best league on the planet and he can't shoot, dribble, shoot or even get a simple layup with just the smallest contact. The first 20-30 games is just absolute boredom of just grinding your player so he's at least decent. The nthe all star comes and it's pretty funny and the second half of the seasone is pretty fun. The playoffs is near and so is the awards. After the first seasone the mode becomes really boring. It's not even hard scoring 120 points. The AI is too bad and the pass the ball then run left and cut is absolutely game breaking. You need no iq and no skill to be good at myCareer you just need to grind for 2 weeks. The park is boring and the Rec center is pretty fun if you are 5 friends playing otherwise you'll just get a team of ball hogs. myTeam is what it is either you grind and will still be at a disadvantage after 100 of hours grinding. The mode basically begs you to pump in money into it. The cards are just too good and it takes out all the skill. They are also really unrealistic (like dribbling 3pt shooter shaq) The gameplay is nothing like basketball in myTeam. people just run around 6 feet outside the 3pt line and the shoots a deep three and ofcourse it hits because the cards are to op. I don't really play myLeague so i don't have a opinion i do play myGM tho. My experince of myGM was positiv i found it really fun but i haven't played any other myGM so i can't really compare it. Overall the game is pretty bad and the rec center (with friends), the first my carrer season (after 52 games) and playing against your friends with nba rosters is the only fun part about the game. 2k do better ffs"

There are actual interactions before games that tell you your clothes suck you should buy new ones, which of course cost VC. Your character in MyCareer might as well not even try to take any shots or layups until you can upgrade them. I've literally watched shots that were perfect jump out of the hoop, breaking the games physics because it was determined by a number it wasnt good. Everything about this games design is made to make you spend extra money on a $60 or more purchase and with 2k21 even worse and costing $70 at base, 2k is probably more predatory and worse than EA at this point.

1089350,2,0,cu6it,53,5,-1,67.7,"11 July, 2020","If you bought it on sale good. BUT this game is a poster-boy/girl for in-game transactions. Almost any action or aspect of the game (mycareer) will need you to either grind for hours for just a small improvement or pay up for VC to actually play the game. As well this game may only have servers up for 2 years, so any of the effort may actually be for nothing. Also MyTeam is just about the same. Random RNG to see if you might get something useful, but in reality you just won't get jack.MYCareer is also a heap of trash. The ""story"" is just a giant cringe. Playing is a chore. It really is just something to kill time with, with no real reward after even 10+ hours.The AI is terrible. Even a ported Garry's Mod NPC could probably do better, EX: 90's level players brick layup after layup. A player known for inside play and grabbing boards will grab a rebound, dribble out to the three point line then hold the ball forever till lobbing it to a guard or forward to brick a 2-person covered three. It's as if 2K has never actually watched or played a game of basketball in their life. Also, while some people think that the shotstick is a skill-base thing, it's absolute BS. No matter how well you hold it or release it it's pretty much just RNG if you get lucky enough to get a green shot. (Also even with a ""badge"" to make the consequences of poorly timed shotstick usage minimal, you still brick shots randomly.) Seriously it's easier just to run around the AI on defense and hope you get a lucky layup to not be missed. Also, one final sidenote if you hate ads. you will certainly hate this game. It's one walking ad. No matter what you do all you see is ads for gatorade, shoes, or some other random thing.TLDR: The game play is poor. Ingame currency is the pay-to-not-be-trash. Even on sale, don't waste your time."

I will not even waste my time talking about how the AI is totally broken and the problem that every layup you go against an Intimitador Badge will 99% go off. Last NBA 2K game I'm buying until there are major chances to this horrible gameplay since 2k16.2k20 is already going off soon and they again just shove the same mechanics down our throat expecting that we pay more and more.

Despite being relatively inexpensive, I still regret purchasing it. Most of you have already heard about the input lag complaints by other players so I'm not even gonna bother. The AI and the animations are also really terrible. There was a time when I was running the fastbreak in a 2v1 situation and the AI ran straight out of bounds as I was passing the ball, costing me a turnover. Another one was when I passed the ball to the Anthony Davis inside who was wide open, but still did a pump fake which eventually lead to his actual shot attempt getting blocked. The animations and gameplay are simply very buggy. It just screws up MyCareer and gets really annoying. The game also tends to crash sometimes for reasons unknown. I'm not big on the other gamemodes but I guess they're pretty decent. It's obvious that 2K has barely changed in the past couple games, except for some obvious minor changes. It sucks how I prefer 2K15 and 2K16 over this load of garbage."

1089350,0,0,fiestaequestria,321,17,-1,4.5,"11 July, 2020","JFC The cut-scenes.  Upon first launching the game they wouldn't let me skip them.  Then once in MyPlayer mode, there are like a hundred cut-scenes in the first moments of that play mode. I'm not joking.  Just scene after scene after scene after scene after scene after scene....I played maybe 5 minutes of actual basketball and spent another 15 skipping through scenes.  It'd take an hour to actually watch 'em.  What a joke.There's camera wonkiness as well.  Want to play every game mode with the same general side-view camera?  Nope.  The black-top and myPlayer modes (and maybe others) force you to play from a different camera angle, never really letting you get comfortable with one view.  Then in myPlayer mode, your defender will run off the side of the screen, so you run back to try to cover him, but good luck as you're both out of view.  Then the AI will pass to your opponent and he'll score. You'll get dinged points because of a defensive breakdown, but you couldn't even see what the hell was going on.  Fantastic work, 2K.The overall gameplay mechanics are pretty frustrating as well.  Everything is delayed, slow, restrictive.  It feels like you're moving through butter.  Everything requires a length animation, so timing things like rebounding, blocks, and steals are just plain stupid and lame.  Sometimes you get lucky, but most of the time you are just off away from the play jumping by yourself, looking and feeling like an idiot.  I read a review that this game was less about pre-recorded animations, but yeah..that guy was full of it. This game is nothing be pre-recorded animations.  It's so boring and doesn't feel at all like I'm in real control.2K really do suck at this.  It's a shame.  They spent all this time making cut-scenes with Idris Elba, and that squirrelly dude, Thomas Middleditch from Silicon Valley.  If you just want a solid gameplay experience and don't want to pay to watch a crapload of cut-scenes, look elsewhere.  Such a disappointment.  I'd love to sit down with the development team and look them square in the eyes and just say a ton of hurttful things to them.  They deserve it for this shameless money-grab. Glad I got it on extreme discount..now I know why it was so cheap."

1089350,1,0,7.65612E+16,171,2,-1,265.3,"10 July, 2020","I've never bought basketball games for online play and 2k is clearly made for people who want to only/mostly play online and who are willing to grind or spend money for the online game modes. Even then if you read the reviews there are numerous problems. I only bought this when it was on sale for $5 and I play it because I love basketball too much to not be playing an NBA video game.  MyCareer is a ridiculous grind that is constantly trying to get you to spend more money, you cannot turn off 2KTV at all anymore (minor issue but it drives me nuts), and the feel of game 40 in the regular season against a team with a 11-29 record feels the exact same as a Game 7 in the NBA Finals all in MyCareer, MyGM, and MyLeague. They tried to switch up MyGM and I personally don't know what they were going for but it's not fun. MyLeague is fun but you have to manually change everything constantly to get it to feel real. Teams never change their lineups (even in the playoffs they'll go 10 deep in their rotations) unless there are injuries and they don't adapt well in-game. In a tie game late in the 4th quarter you can run pick-n-rolls all day and the most the AI will do is double team. With how much we are able to change in regards to defensive schemes I would like to see the AI be more adaptive. If you are a singleplayer 2K gamer DO NOT BUY UNLESS IT IS ON SALE. I mean AT LEAST 50% OFF. They're going to try to squeeze you for money non-stop after you buy it and it's not even a game worth $30. Don't give them more than you have to just play older 2ks with mods and/or downloaded rosters."

Even with this game being on the summer sell I do not feel it is worth the money as it is just a polished 2k15. Yeah there may be new stuff but, in the end, it is just the same game every year. It will probably be another 5 or so years before I get another one and at that point it will be because 2k made this one unplayable."

Offline play just awesome but if you are buying it for My Career Online Matching dont you even try to buy. All players are maxed their characters. Keep making 3 pts and 0 balance on teams. Also players understand that you are a beginner so they dont want to team up with you. So I can easily say there is no ranking system and you have to keep play against good players or 3 point spammers... Offline is ok. Only thing is some of the moves are not even realistic. For example when you want to drive in they keep holding you like you hit a wall. Its impossible push someone on attacking side and when you try to push your character holds ball. So dumb.

I have yet to test the graphical limits of this game because my PC is almost a decade old and itching for an upgrade, but with the right setting tweaks, I can run this on 1080p low shader setting and no special effects at 60fps with minimal stutters due to CPU bottleneck. Also, this game is probably only worth buying if it's on sale (which I did) and you only want to play myleague or mycareer, or on a physical preorder because of the free poster you can get with the Legend edition.PC UPGRADE UPDATE: I've finally tried the online portion of the game, and it's just terrible. I have a good fiber optic internet connection, but since the servers are not even optimized for my country, it takes probably like 250ms to move my player or do anything. But at least the singleplayer portion of every game mode is okay. Still not worth the full price. Only recommending this because I like it more than I hate it, plus I'm a total pleb for basketball games."

MyCareer, while started nicely with the story, looks like 2k17 (where your teamates are awful and opponents godlike).PROS:- My League is improved- Graphics and gameplay are decent (if you control the entire team !!)- MyCareer archetypes are better than 17 but still not as good as the old 2k (where you could build the player as you wanted) CONS:- P2W (I mean look at MyTeam and MyCareer/neighborhood). Even EA doesn't make its ""MyPlayer"" so grindy- MyCareer teamates & gameplay: they are beyond stupid. Attempt shots even myself I wouldn't dare- MyCareer opponent AI = OP. Every game, they get around 70% shooting and me (Houston Rockets) around 35%. What am I suppose to do as a rebounding center? Chase down the wide open 3s? Stop teamates attempt to shoot instead of doing a layup with no one around them?"

Granted, I waited for it to go on sale for less than $10. It's definitely worth that price."

No anti-cheat in the park, someone with a higher rep can just take your place in a game no matter how long you've been waiting, no matchmaking unless you go in Rec Center (but it takes forever to actually find a game) or play Pro-Am (you need a team and it's competitive play), MyCareer is basically Grind simulator (unless you pay for VCs but even buying 200k won't get your guy at a 90. MyTeam is basically a big pay to win. Can't get good cards unless you decide to stop living a real life and just play that game for the rest of your life (unless you give 2K all your family's savings, in which case you may pull some good cards). No changes have been made to MyLeague since last year. Only real improvement they made is bring the WNBA in the game, which is pretty good, but I don't play PlayNow. Unfortunately it's the only BasketBall game out there so 2K can do whatever they want. Please don't buy 2K21."

I was completely lost in the myriad of options that are focused around MyTeam, MyCareer, MyCasino, MyPlayerPacks, MyEvolutionPacks, MyLegends, MyTV, MyDynasty, etc. From annoying hosts who introduce every in-game option with an unskippable movie explaining every last feature in bludgeoning detail to the 10,000 create-a-shoe options, I have no idea how console players put up with this agonizing experience every year. After 47 minutes of pure frustration, I hit the refund button.  I don't know if this game is good or not.  But I do know that basketball is not the focus of this.

I've already requested a refund at the time of writing this review. Even though the game is 85% off.I'll explain why. For me the most fun part of the NBA games is the MyGM mode. So its what I went straight into with this game. First of all, the expansion teams were gone. So you couldn't start off as an expansion team, the first red flag. Since previous games had this. Next the MyGM mode doesn't allow you to choose between starting the season straight away or starting in the off-season. You start in the season. Second red flag. You are consistently given tasks as soon as there is a space for one. Which wouldn't be a bad thing, but the Head Coach for the most part just wanted me to trade players. So I had to choose between doing the trades for experience to unlock skill points or ignore the tasks which makes him dislike and distrust you. Another red flag. Unlocking chit chat seems to be an important part of the skill tree because with it you can build a small amount of trust and morale boosts, without it you'll might end up struggling with poor trust and morale problems. More red flags. You almost have to do an action everyday of the season or end the day, because if you decide to skip the week instead and a team wants to make a trade offer. You can't stop the skip and look at the offer if you decide to skip the week.  Plus one to the red flag pile. The final straw that breaks me. Going into the draft no one on the staff has mentioned who I should draft, so I draft whoever I want. Only for after the draft the head coach to tell me who he wants me to draft (its already too late) and the right away after that gets mad at me for not drafting the player he wanted when the draft was already over!That's at least 6 different problems or choices that have been removed from previous iterations of NBA 2K. F*****g 6, that I noticed within 2 hours of MyGM mode! I had low expectations buying this game, but when you ruin my personal favourite aspect of the game. There is nothing left for me. I could go on about other things as well like a story mode version being gone or the fact that certain actions are now behind a skill point progression system. But I can't be bothered wasting my time anymore. Should have learned my lesson from the 2k19, but at least this time I should get a refund."

DO NOT BUY for any more than that.Pros: I miss basketball because of the quarantineThe my career story mode made me laugh a bunchCons:Nothing is done to make my life easier as a keyboard player. All the drill instructions are only shown as if I had a controller so I constantly have to check the key bindings to know what to do.Controls seem unresponsive sometimes, most notably movement and reboundingSettings DON'T SAVE: every time i launch the game i need to switch it to full screen mode but much worse is that EVERY TIME i sub into the game I need to change the camera mode because the default sucks AND when ever i sim to my next appearance i have to tab out and in to the game multiple times to actually make it work.In conclusion I really want to like this game more than I do, the last 2k game i played on PC was 2k14 and it's mindblowing that things like the lack of keyboard ""support"" and control issues are the exact same with the addition of settings not saving. Otherwise the gameplay is the exact same but with better graphics and imo a worse music selection than 2k14. Sure I should play with a controller but I don't have one and haven't really looked into getting one. But why should I spend upwards of 80$ on a controller I'd probably use for 1 game?Thank you for coming to my ted talk. 2k Sports do better."

Online servers are absolute garbage, impossible to play without severe lag. MyTeam has went to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, nearly every player has their own diamond or pink diamond card, this takes away any realism the tiers have had in the past. Lastly, playing the game against the CPU is awful. Impossible to balance the game where the CPU is competitive but not cheesing you on every play. If you want a somewhat realistic CPU that matches your skill level but also keeps the game somewhat realistic, be prepared to spend countless hours adjusting sliders. Also, there seems to be minor input lag when it comes to jump shot releases, which makes hitting jump shot random and not skill based whatsoever. In conclusion, this is an awful 2k game."

TL:DR - I'm leaving a positive review only because it is better than 2K19 (Left a negative one on that), if you don't mind spending for 2K and wants to get the 19-20 roster, go ahead, especially during the sale. I will list down the things that are better below: -The UI's layout and design in the game. You go into your MyCareer static page first before you hop into Neighborhood. You don't have to load the world to go into the animations store.-Camera work is slightly better, no first-person view when sitting out the game, new cutscenes during pre-game.-You can choose your specialization badge freely, which is pretty great.-Movement is more realistic compared to the previous one, deciding to shoot will cost you a few milliseconds more.-Waiting for your next appearance became interesting, instead of a simple fading to black transition.-WNBA-You can play Draft Combine and Summer League during the prologue.Now.. for the cons:-Graphically identical to 2K19. You wont notice a difference, at least to me it didn't.-Timeouts are still a waste of time for them to show their sponsors.-Story sucked compared to the last one, didn't even cared for my own character let alone the others. Short too.Will list as I play more..."

I'd played every nba 2k up until 2k13 since that was the last one for ps3 and then i stopped buying consoles.  every single 2k since for pc was always full price on steam and then pulled once the new one came out.  2k20 has been the only one that went on sale.  so at sale price, i'm fine with it.  especially since 2019 was a short nba season and 2020 could be no season, this is all the nba we've got right now.  if 2k21 comes on at full price, i'm probably just going to stick with 2k20.  i also tried blacktop mode 1 on 1 and that was fun."

The 2K game series featuring best in class graphics & gameplay, ground breaking game modes, and unparalleled player control and customization. NBA 2K20 was developed by Visual Concepts and published by 2K.Release Date : 5th September 2019.Last known update: 29th May 2020.ðŸŽ®Gameplay:Is this game really the most realistic basketball game?Playing basketball and the basics of 2K:Well long story short, this is easily the best game as far as gameplay goes, when playing the game you can easily think that this is a legit real life scenario. Shooting mechanics are basically what you expect, everytime you take a jumpshot a shooting bar appears next to your player and if you manage to cover 100% of the bar you get an excellent release which means your shot will hit, unless you get blocked or 2K decides to make you suffer. Obviously you have a huge variety of dribbling moves that are basically real life moves the game even offers streetball moves, in order to successfully perform some of these moves you will need to memorize the patterns for the right analog stick, after that you can break some ankles. Defense has been decently talked about as it got nerfed badly compared to the solid defense we got in NBA2K19, defense feels basically a lot slower and not as body to body aggressive. Donâ€™t be surprised if you see people spamming the steal button as this is probably the most logical defensive tactic in 2K at this exact moment. Lastly passing is something that hasnâ€™t really changed since 2K16 or 2K17, long distance passing is literally a meme as you will never hit your teammate, alley oops are still OP after they got nerfed in 2k14, to use them as many times as possible especially if you got athletic players on your team. Overall the basic essence of the game is more than solid but the unfair advantage of offense is a little bit to harsh.Gamemodes:Play Now: In quick play you can match up against today NBA teams as well as some historical teams dating back in the 1960s as well as some All-time teams that feature the best players in the history of each team. Some smaller modes within that mode include Play WNBA that allows you to play with the female NBA teams, NBA Today that allows you to play with today's NBA teams with all the updated ratings, matchups and injuries,Play Now Online is a ranking mode that matches you up against other players worldwide and after each win you collect points in order to improve your ranking lastly Blacktop which was one of my favourite modes back in the day is a nice mode that can go from 1 vs 1 to 5 vs 5 in a street ball setting that allows players to do crazy moves and dunks but fouls as many times as they want to.My Team: Is a card and rank based mode that needs a lot of grinding, the rankings of each card can go from Bronze to Pink Diamond Opal and some special edition cards are included,you can do challenges, online matches, offline matches and many more activities sadly they removed one great feature which was The Gauntlet that allowed you to take 3 players and start a Blacktop type match, still disappointed that it got removed.My Career: Is the story based Single and Multiplayer Hybrid aspect, this year is kinda special as 2K added some well known figures to play in the story like Idris Elba as the coach and LeBron James as...well as Lebron James. You start off as a young player with major leader potential basically a guy that cares about his team and winning instead of stats and personal awards, after your good friend and teammate gets a season / Career ending injury you decide to show your frustration by not playing and having a small feud with your coach, as always everything works out and you get drafted and meet Lebron in his personal plane and decides to give a cringey dialogue that made me rip my ears off my head. Other than the ripping ears off my head I enjoyed the Single Player campaign, after that you get put into the Online mode and youâ€™re greeted with the same things as 2k19 , Neighborhood, Parks, Sweaty MyPark guys and Connection Issues.My League: Is basically Manager mode, where you can select a team and make them win championships, make trades, break the bank and sign a superstar and have jerseys retired and all that good stuff. My GM Is an identical mode just a lot more hardcore with more things to do.ðŸŒ‡Graphics / Audio:Honestly, NBA 2K games have probably the best face scans since NBA 2K14, you will be amazed by the visuals.Graphics:https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1865032563https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1859551512Audio / Soundtrack:The soundtrack is great as always, like its really good, voice acting is spot on simply because the same commentators in real life talk in the game as well.ðŸŒ€Performance:In Game:AMD Ryzen 5 3600 X, 16GB RAM, RTX 2070 S:I was running the game on Ultra Settings 1080p with 60fps. Note:60fps is the capIntel Core i5 5200U, 8GB RAM, Intel HD 5500:Believe it or not I was running the game on Low Settings 720p with 28 -30 fps.ðŸ–¥ï¸Bugs / Glitches / Crashes:The game was terrible at launch after 6 months it got fixed but I still get to see some minor bugs like at halftime where they display the stats you get the bug that shows that you got as many assists as points, some random crashes happen as well but nothing major. In around 200 hours of being a mediocre 2k Player I had no game breaking issues.ðŸ’²Price:For 50 Euros you get a decent game but I would wait for sales.âš–ï¸Conclusion:NBA 2K20 had a terrible launch but after months it is a pleasant experience now with a ton of content and stuff to do, it is a decent sports game.ðŸ“‰Overall rating: 74/ 100Date of the Review:16.06.2020This product was reviewed using a free key provided by the Developers.Follow our curator page, OCG-Curations, if you like and want to see more reviews like this one."

1089350,1,0,Alphaomega5732,490,12,-1,39.5,"27 June, 2020","First the game doesn't recognize a PS4 controller.  I literally have free games in my library that do this.  But this has been a feature of 2k as long as I can remember.  So get Steam set up and finally get my controller working only to find that my controller buttons don't match the default Xbox buttons in game, so another feature from 2k.Finally I get the game working and it asks me to accept the online policy which I refuse because I only play single player ""My League"" and ""My Career"".  Unfortunately this leads to another issue, because 2k has made single player offline impossible.  In order to play single player ""My Career"" you must be online 24-7.  Why?  Greed.  2K wants milk every possible dime out of their players for their $60 AAA game, and they couldn't allow someone to play single player offline, because they cant monetize it.  This is where the pirated version would actually be better than the original game.So finally I accept the TOS for online play (at this point almost 45 minutes in and still I haven't played, because I like to read what I accept) and the game starts.  I am able to play ""My Career"".What follows is a travesty.  240p real images and potato quality real video are interspersed between ultra high realistic 2k resolution graphics.   The result is bizarre.  But hey at least they added the ability to skip the majority of cut scenes.   So, so many cut scenes.  I start out listening to the story and realize is just the usual trope, so I begin to skip through the cut scenes.  At one point Thomas Middleditch is on the screen, so I watch that part to see if he's funny.  He says ""Man, I am sweating like a fat kid in a candy shop"".  That seems insensitive to children with obesity, but also on par with 2k.So I start skipping again, play some college games, combine, everything is going okay.  Finally I get to the point where I am drafted to a NBA team and can actually start the ""My Career"" portion of ""My Career"".  Only I can't.  I set on the bench and it says press A to sim to next time I am put in the game.  But that doesn't work.  I press X (A) and the message goes away and I am stuck watching the team play from the sidelines for the entirety of the game.  And as an added side bonus, they are now moving at 1/8th the speed, so a 6 minute quarter lasts about 48 minutes, entire game will 192 minutes of me just waiting on the bench to be subbed in.I read up online and find that you can alt tab to fix this problem.  So I do that and it works one time.  After that it either doesn't work at all or the game freezes up and crashes.  At one point it somehow crashed so hard it broke my multiple monitor set up.  After several hard reboots, hours of watching from the sideline, I finally just give up.  Literally the worst gaming experience for 2k to date, and the bar was already very low.The real kicker?  Because I was in game unable to play, reading the TOS, and skipping through 100s of cutscenes just to get to the point where the game was playable:  I can no longer get a refund, so now I'm stuck with this POS that I can't even play the one mode that I bought the game for.  At $9 it's still a complete and utter rip off.  Obviously if you don't play career mode this may not affect you, I haven't tried any other modes because I could care less about them.EDIT: So apparently this is a known bug since the release of the game.  There is a work around that requires you to downgrade your graphic performance to 60Hz, but to date there doesn't appear to be any fix for this bug.   So if you are playing this game on PC with 144Hz, it simply won't work.Update: Found more bugs, sometimes L Bumper brings up play calling, sometimes it brings up icons.  Sometimes you can press pass and it passes the ball, occasionally you just stand there holding the ball and nothing happens.  There is a lot of downtime in the game where you are just waiting until the game let's you skip ahead to the part where you can actually play the game.  In my career your player is super gimped.  I choose the speed over every other aspect for my physical, unfortunately after playing 15 hours and getting 10k free VC from 2k, my speed is at 76 out of a possible 87 - which means 90% of the people I pair up with just blow by me.   Even if you do great in the game, the difference between doing medicroe and excellent is just a few 100 VC, which won't buy much.  2KTV used to be an option that you could turn off, apparently not any more.  Turning off camera shake doesn't actually turn off camera shake.  Update: Apparently you are stuck with the nickname CHE?  even after changing your nickname they still refer to you as CHE wtf is that?  Yet another bug in an endless sea of bugs for this barely worth $9 game.  After putting in 30 hours, I still am haven't come close to my maximum physical abilities, meaning that after 500-1000 hours I might actually peak and be an above average player - or you know, you could just spend a few $100 and pay to win.  In addition you are constantly bombarded with Gatorade, Beats,etc. in game advertisements.  At one point they asked me if I would allow them to email an ad in real life for a real life gatorade product.  If this is sponsored by all these corporations in game, why am I paying for the game.  Beats headphones are literally the worst headphones on the market.  I worked as a tech at a computer store and every other week some parent came in with these cheap Chinese headphones asking if we could repair them.  Nope, they are literally crap.  Beats headphones are total junk for any audiophile worth 2 cents, but here in game I have to listen to countless ads about how great the Beats headphones are.. They are junk. worthless crap.  It's insulting to have to listen to in game advertisements for something that is utterly junk, but that pretty much sums up the entire 2k basketball experience at this point...If someone was to make a basketball game tomorrow with just basketball, no 2ktv, no stories, no pay to win tactics - I would be all in."

Thankfully, I don't really care about MyCareer nor MyTeam mode. All I care about is the MyLeague mode. I can only laugh about the casino games because they are so absurd and ridiculous. This kind of thing just does not belong in a serious sports simulation and always distracts me from the actual game, because I want to play basketball in NBA 2K and not spin lucky wheels. Without casino and VC, NBA 2K would be a far better game. So I get that it makes a few missteps in several modes and the gameplay is also pretty much the same as before, but itâ€™s still a reigning champion in its genre as EA going hiatus with Live. Until next year's 2K21 vs Live 21, maybe? Since EA is bringing most of its games to Steam. Hopefully."

If you just want to sit back, relax, and enjoy basketball, this is it.If you wanted to play MyCareer but don't want to invest in a player, just play MyLeague and use ""player lock"". Create your character, customize however you like and enjoy.Online play is non-existent. Don't even bother.The increased difficulty in MyLeague make me want to come back to the game mode every single time I play. 2K have nerfed some parts of the stat system like a players potential. Someone who's A+ in potential may only shine if he has players who revolve around his play-style. Although, I find that you need a star in order to win a championship. Mediocre 80 overalls won't get you anywhere but the second round.Virtual currency is very lenient this game. You can get an easy 1500 each game. They implemented a progression feature with the MyCareer character that allows you to progress through basketball. The progression blocks the player from increasing overalls. But, it allows the character to develop in a realistic fashion, although, very grindy. That's why I mentioned the MyLeague option.If you enjoy basketball and offline play, it's something to look forward to when it's on sale. Looking for multiplayer?

1089350,127,8,TNuhcBoy,39,1,-1,314.9,"24 June, 2020","Here is my honest assessment of the 2K series and this game. I read most of the bad reviews and I read most of the good reviews prior to buying this game. I have not owned or played NBA 2K since 2K16. So I decided to buy this game when it was on sale. I can honestly say that I will never buy another NBA 2K game ever again without some serious changes. This game at its core has not changed much since 2K16. This port for PC is really awful. If you're trying to play online then you are just wasting your time, between the input lag, the net code, and the 2K servers, the online play is dreadful. One of the biggest reason why I quit playing NBA 2K was because the servers were not good. They have not been good the past few years and this year was the worst I have experienced by far. I have watched countless hours of YouTuber's who play this game and it looks bad for them too, I will say that online play seems to run a little smoother on PS4 and Xbox but I am only saying that cause of the  YouTube videos I have seen. I don't know why the online connections on PC are so bad but it is unplayable. Outside of the 2K servers, the other reason I will never buy another NBA 2K game again unless changes are made, is because of all the microtransactions. All 2K cares about is money. Everything you do in this game involves money. I personally have only played MyTeam mode. I read to many horror stories about the other online game modes, so I stuck with MyTeam only. This mode could be a lot better. If you are a player that chooses not to pay money, then you are in for one long grind. The sad part about the grind is, outside of the GOAT Galaxy Opal Kobe card, the rewards you get are not really worth grinding for. As mentioned previously, I can never connect to matches and if I do, it is a lag fest the whole time. You will also notice as a non-paying player that you will be at an extreme disadvantage against paying players. No matter your skill level, if someone has a stacked team, 9 times out of 10 they will beat you, and there is not a whole lot that can be done about it, and it is all because they bought it and it is another ploy from 2K to try and get you to spend money. I will admit that I have a good paying job, so it sadly affords me the opportunity to indulge myself on needless expenses, such as buying VC for packs. Be that as it may, getting such a late start to MyTeam, kind of forces you to pay if I want to get good players in a limited time. To those that wonder if paying money for VC to buy packs is worth it, I will tell you it is not. That is another reason why I feel cheated with this NBA 2K game. Even when you decide to spend money on the game, the pack odds are terrible. The chances of pulling the same duplicate cards seems to be a lot higher than need to be and at the end of the day, if you do pull a Galaxy Opal, chances are it is going to be the worst one. The amount of money that I have spent in the little I have played this game is not worth the rewards that you get. The offline modes would be better, but as I have seen in several reviews, the input lag on PC is bad. The players go out of their way to do the weirdest moves on the simplest of commands. Unless I am wide open and not moving, almost every shot has a delay, and it is multiplied by a 1000 when playing online. If you read this far, then you've probable guessed that I am just writing this review because I am annoyed at spending money and not getting the best players. That may have been very annoying for me, I just wanted to tell you the truth from someone who isn't paid to write nice things about this game, my assessment is true. I am not a YouTuber, and I am not a Streamer, I am just that regular everyday person who really wanted this game to be good, and  it just isn't which is sad. I promise I don't regret spending the money on the packs, my annoyance with that is that the pack odds seems to favor 2K and again- their idea of making money off people. Plain and simple please stop buying 2K games and spending your money on this company. At the end of the day this company cares about one thing, and that is themselves. They make billions of dollars from players every year, and every year this game does not improve, mainly their servers, what could be the best aspect of this game, playing online with your buddy from across the country, turns into an unplayable lag fest. Never invest your time or money into a company that is littered with microtransactions and allows people to be pay to win. I just wish NBA Live would return and be somewhat decent, that may give 2K a reason to go back and do better and realize what use to make this game fun in the first place. Do Not Buy."

The game play will always be crisp and refined and represents the NBA game faithfully. The level of detail they put into the game modes is also phenomenal. The thing that I hate that NBA 2K has become is a walking billboard advertisement for other products. You can't escape it...and they down right will play a commercial for you while going into a game sometimes. VC (virtual currency) is a concept I wish they would do away with, but it makes them extra money and it is here to stay.Bottom Line:- If you are looking for a game where the core game play is fundamentally sound with extreme levels of detail in many game modes then 2K20 is for you.

The inclusion of the WNBA may be this yearâ€™s biggest step forward, especially because it does an excellent job showcasing the many gameplay improvements from last year. MyCareer also continues to improve in small and noticeable ways, setting a new standard for story modes in sports games. Still, NBA 2K20 would have been better off by focusing on its complex modes like MyLeague and cleaning up MyTeam to be less dependent on microtransactions.

All you can really do at the beginning is pass and look for assists but I just threw one straight through Lebrons hands so whats the point?  I feel like my team and player struggle to make shots solely because this company wants me to go buy vc.  If it were logical and easier, thered be no need for VC at all.  Theres strategic nonsensical difficulty implemented here by the designers to make the grind unpleasant and drawn out to milk money out of the players.  Does anyone else feel like their shot indicators are ridiculous as well?  They need to check the definition of VERY because 99% of the time VERY late or early seemed barely late or early at all.  I cant tell you how many times I filled that bar all the way up and was wide open and still got a slightly late or early.  Its honestly unreal how bad this game is.  And I attribute it 100% to them pushing the vc on everyone.  ""Buy our overpriced NBA 2k19 knock off and then buy $99 worth of garbage that isnt going to mean anything in 6 months when the next one comes out! Oh and watch these ads for Kia while the screens load!""  The fact that 2k19 and 2k18 are still $60 should say a lot about this company.  Can we riot against gaming companies next?  Seriously, they need to stop putting pay to win mechanics in full priced games.  Especially ones that COME OUT YEARLY AND ARE THE SAME GAME EVERY YEAR.  The difference between years is so minimal its pathetic!The story is trash too.  Heres an idea, how about we make our own decisions and build our own story?  Instead of just watching our character play out some inept nonsensical story themselves."

Like almost 90% of the other reviews this is a legit copy of 2k19. The only difference is the new way to build your characters which granted is cool and works well. Everything else sucks. The AI is one of the worst things I have ever seen in a video game. You can have Anthony Davis who is 97 in my career mode and he goes like 1-10 in the paint against Trae young. That's not even a joke. The AI almost never posts up or do any good moves, if you pass them the ball in the paint they will take the ugliest most contested shot right away with like 15 seconds left on the shot clock. This would be fine if they were like 80 overall but we are talking about the Player that's on the cover of your game. They refuse to add more features and or fix anything. I understand that career mode is not as profitable but this company make an insane amount of cash on this game and as consumers we deserve a better product.Dont buy this game if already own a 2K game made in the last 5 years. You're wasting your money and you only give them the power to continue to improve nothing about their games. Idiots like myself and other ""loyal"" fans are the reason these games never improve.

Last time I played 2k was on the Nintendo Wii.  Ok so, MyCareer/MyPlayer and MyLeague are fun.  I haven't touched MyTeam, and don't think I will.  I'm not into collecting cards but whatever. But when it comes to MyCareer, it's super fun.  I don't get a feeling much when i play the league and it's a bunch of repetition.  I like the progression and it's fun.  I made it all the way through two seasons with one character and will start another one.  Awesome fun stuff. Standard game mode is an A+When it comes to online play, this is what you can expect:As with any PC game expect hackers.  Super long arms, OP shooters, I don't even see the best youtubers shoot this well.  They hacking, and if you like to cheat to win then go ahead and do that.  I personally, don't care, if i see it, i just don't join them or play against them.  There's absolutely no REC games.  So don't try.  you'll be waiting for hours to find one game, which mind you by the time a game is found, the players are AFK and the game get's cancelled.  A suggestion here is to visualize how many are needed in a rec game to get it started while you're in the park and not taking a shot in the dark. Hope that gets seenBut for the most part, 90% of the people play the game straight up.  It's fun.  There's not a lot of people, but that's okay.  There's enough to have each park about 50% capacity and a little higher during peak hours.  Online Play gets a B for me."

The 2K game series featuring best in class graphics & gameplay, ground breaking game modes, and unparalleled player control and customization. NBA 2K20 was developed by Visual Concepts and published by 2K.Release Date : 5th September 2019.Last known update: 29th May 2020.ðŸŽ®Gameplay:Is this game really the most realistic basketball game?  Playing basketball and the basics of 2K:Well long story short, this is easily the best game as far as gameplay goes, when playing the game you can easily think that this is a legit real life scenario. Shooting mechanics are basically what you expect, everytime you take a jumpshot a shooting bar appears next to your player and if you manage to cover 100% of the bar you get an excellent release which means your shot will hit, unless you get blocked or 2K decides to make you suffer. Obviously you have a huge variety of dribbling moves that are basically real life moves the game even offers streetball moves, in order to successfully perform some of these moves you will need to memorize the patterns for the right analog stick, after that you can break some ankles. Defense has been decently talked about as it got nerfed badly compared to the solid defense we got in NBA2K19, defense feels basically a lot slower and not as body to body aggressive. Donâ€™t be surprised if you see people spamming the steal button as this is probably the most logical defensive tactic in 2K at this exact moment. Lastly passing is something that hasnâ€™t really changed since 2K16 or 2K17, long distance passing is literally a meme as you will never hit your teammate, alley oops are still OP after they got nerfed in 2k14, to use them as many times as possible especially if you got athletic players on your team. Overall the basic essence of the game is more than solid but the unfair advantage of offense is a little bit to harsh. Gamemodes:Play Now: In quick play you can match up against today NBA teams as well as some historical teams dating back in the 1960s as well as some All-time teams that feature the best players in the history of each team. Some smaller modes within that mode include Play WNBA that allows you to play with the female NBA teams, NBA Today that allows you to play with today's NBA teams with all the updated ratings, matchups and injuries,Play Now Online is a ranking mode that matches you up against other players worldwide and after each win you collect points in order to improve your ranking lastly Blacktop which was one of my favourite modes back in the day is a nice mode that can go from 1 vs 1 to 5 vs 5 in a street ball setting that allows players to do crazy moves and dunks but fouls as many times as they want to.My Team: Is a card and rank based mode that needs a lot of grinding, the rankings of each card can go from Bronze to Pink Diamond Opal and some special edition cards are included,you can do challenges, online matches, offline matches and many more activities sadly they removed one great feature which was The Gauntlet that allowed you to take 3 players and start a Blacktop type match, still disappointed that it got removed.My Career: Is the story based Single and Multiplayer Hybrid aspect, this year is kinda special as 2K added some well known figures to play in the story like Idris Elba as the coach and LeBron James as...well as Lebron James. You start off as a young player with major leader potential basically a guy that cares about his team and winning instead of stats and personal awards, after your good friend and teammate gets a season / Career ending injury you decide to show your frustration by not playing and having a small feud with your coach, as always everything works out and you get drafted and meet Lebron in his personal plane and decides to give a cringey dialogue that made me rip my ears off my head. Other than the ripping ears off my head I enjoyed the Single Player campaign, after that you get put into the Online mode and youâ€™re greeted with the same things as 2k19 , Neighborhood, Parks, Sweaty MyPark guys and Connection Issues.My League: Is basically Manager mode, where you can select a team and make them win championships, make trades, break the bank and sign a superstar and have jerseys retired and all that good stuff. My GM Is an identical mode just a lot more hardcore with more things to do.ðŸŒ‡Graphics / Audio:Honestly, NBA 2K games have probably the best face scans since NBA 2K14, you will be amazed by the visuals.  Graphics:https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1865032563https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1859551512 Audio / Soundtrack:The soundtrack is great as always, like its really good, voice acting is spot on simply because the same commentators in real life talk in the game as well.ðŸŒ€Performance: In Game:AMD Ryzen 5 3600 X, 16GB RAM, RTX 2070 S:I was running the game on Ultra Settings 1080p with 60fps. Note:60fps is the capIntel Core i5 5200U, 8GB RAM, Intel HD 5500:Believe it or not I was running the game on Low Settings 720p with 28 -30 fps. ðŸ–¥ï¸Bugs / Glitches / Crashes:The game was terrible at launch after 6 months it got fixed but I still get to see some minor bugs like at halftime where they display the stats you get the bug that shows that you got as many assists as points, some random crashes happen as well but nothing major. In around 200 hours of being a mediocre 2k Player I had no game breaking issues.ðŸ’²Price:For 50 Euros you get a decent game but I would wait for sales.âš–ï¸Conclusion:NBA 2K20 had a terrible launch but after months it is a pleasant experience now with a ton of content and stuff to do, it is a decent sports game.ðŸ“‰Overall rating: 74/ 100 Date of the Review:16.06.2020"

It's more frustrating than fun even when you get good and are playing on harder difficulties. and it seems to be getting worse each year...If you want to achieve your dream of becoming an NBA legend or assembling a Myteam dream team, you better be prepared to waste a lot of your valuable time or spend a lot of your valuable money. You could play Mygm but it's just plain boring, so few features have changed or evolved for the last 5 years and the Storyline they try to wedge into it feels slow and more like a boring conversation simulator.Sure it's the best basketball game out there right now but if they keep going in this direction i can see an exodus of users when a competitor starts noticing and makes a better game, which wouldn't be that difficult.This franchise has stopped respecting it's users and instead are manipulating kids into forking over their parents money.Buy it in a sale (at best) or even better play real-life basketball."

I'm a big fan of NBA 2k, last game I had before this was NBA 2k14(Sorry, I don't always buy the next game that comes out.) So anyways here Are my takes1) The Story in MyPlayer was good, really enjoyed the the character progression and occasional cut scenes when you start playing in the league. No issue on the FaceScan.2) Shoes in the game really got me like changing all the players in my team so that's win.3) The Rebounding here is very hard. AI occasionally does like 3-5 Offensive rebound consecutively when they miss and I can't get my team to have a rebounding dominant stats.4) Shooting in HOF is very hard. Rarely goes in.5) My team mates who I'm not controlling are dumb. When a opponent cuts through the basket my AI team sometimes take a step in the opposite direction as if they intentionally letting the AI enemy score.6) The Difficulty level makes no sense, I'm able to outscore a opponent like 30+ points in Superstar(Which makes it boring) but when I go to HOF they outscore me like 30. I was assuming that by going to HOF opponents will be able to play smart(Make Plays more often) but they're still dumb. the only reason they are winning is they can hit the basket even while I'm defending right in front of them and my Shot aren't even though I executed a perfectly good play just to have my 3 pointer get open.Sorry but this is a step back from the 2k14 that I played."

1089350,1,0,TIGF,271,1,1,145.2,"1 June, 2020","If you've ever played a NBA 2K game before you know exactly what your getting into. While I don't support 2k or it's Microtransaction-mania; or in-game advertisements; or incredibly obnoxious product placement; for the majority of the time this is a solid, playable game. So sit back and relax, as me and my 43 hours of in game experience take you on a journey into 2K tomfoolery.Lets start with the actual basketball game mechanics. To sum it up, the gameplay in 2k20 is a smoother version of 2k19. Players will cut, drive and dunk much faster and have less of a chance of getting stuck to a defender who is spamming R2 (I swear every computer is doing it). 3-pointers are more important, players will attempt (and make) them at a higher rate. The AI generally has been improved too, they will make smarter plays, and play more like they're real life counterparts. They still get stuck on screens though, and occasionally get janky when it comes to contested shots off a pass, (or anything player initiated).The music is the same-ish as the last few years; though I swear the variety in music genre is less and less as years go by. For the most part 2k20 just takes the top 50 artists and throw in they're B-list songs. Unfortunately nothings going to top Kurtis Blow or his Basketball song about Basketball.MyCareer has gotten better; 2k seems to have reduced the grind and the importance of VC accumulation. It only took 10 hours of playtime to get my guy up to an 80 overall. Which is a significant improvement from other years where I went the entire NBA regular season only to peak at a solid 77 overall. The biggest change to MyCareer (and honestly the game as a whole) is to the player ""Archetype"" system. They give a lot more control in designing your players physical attributes. Skill-wise you get a nifty looking pie-chart that defines your overall in each main category (Finishing, Shooting, Playmaking and Defense). After that they let you edit your own skill caps for each individual skill (like 3-point shooting or Offensive Rebound), setting maxes to each skill based on the pie chart you selected at the beginning. If this sounds like a sham, that's because it kind of is; the only thing that matters is the pie chart you choose as the game will only let you max out your skills to fit that chart (give or take a few skill points). It gives you that nice veneer of player control without the actual ability to customize anything. Its not a perfect system, but it still gives you more control over your players play-style than last year, and its nice to know that 2K is willing to listen even just a little to the player base that complained about player archetypes in the past. Other than that MyCareer is essentially the same as 2k19 (with a different story of course). You take control of an up and coming NBA rookie, and navigate through at least one NBA season playing with (and against) the leagues best. All the while increasing your attributes with VC and getting cool endorsements/obvious product placement from real world companies (GATORADE WHOO). I don't play much in the way of My GM, but from what I've seen it hasn't changed from previous years. Online is a little sketchy, and you might have a little trouble getting into a game. But even that's playable if your willing to overlook the  occasional hour long wait time, and the occasional cheaters (one time the entire other team was on fire for the entire game). Every other game mode is pretty much the same. You still have your quick-play, your season mode, and the illustrious franchise mode. These are all effectively the same as last year, which for me  is fine because how much is a regular season mode going to change in any sports game. League expansion is still here as well, for all of you who wanted to navigate the Flint Tropics to another NBA title.All in all the game itself isn't that bad, not much has changed from 2k19, the stuff that has changed is mostly for the better. 2K' s VC nonsense is still here but at least in MyCareer they've significantly nerfed it's importance in terms of overall player development. And yes in game ads are a thing, but they're not as bad/invasive as people make them seem. They're mostly for in game apparel, or custom animations. Things that don't really affect gameplay at all. And nothing that other games don't already do (I'm looking at you Fortnite). The worst is the 2k video series that plays every time you load a game. I'm convinced that nobody actually interacts or watches these, except for when they offer free VC for answering a poll. My biggest gripe with the in game currency is that short shorts for your My Player cost 5,000 VC. I had to grind 5 NBA regular season games out just so I could show off a little leg in the neighborhood.If your thinking about buying the game, at this point I would wait for it to go on sale. Either that or wait for 2k21 to come out.TL:DR 2K20 has made small, but mostly positive changes to 2K19, and has downplayed the importance of in game VC (its still there). I'm interested on whether 2k will continue to make changes based on user feedback. Maybe someday that will mean the end of VC, and in game ads? Idk as long as I get to customize my own GATORADE bottle I won't complain.Oh and the MyCareer cut scenes are still pretty cheesy, but I mean what do you expect? Its a game about basketball, not a Disney Original Series."

Horrible lag when trying to edit the appearance of My Player. I last played this game as NB 2k15 and it was pretty good. Somehow 2k have managed to remove good aspects of the game and bring it down a notch. Most unforgivable though is the 'Pay To Win' mentality. 2k seems to care more about getting their customers to pay real monet for virtual clothes and accessories and to level up your player. Poor effort 2k. Won't be buying future versions.

Oh and did I mention theres no report function, yea nah its not there. it is on console tho    This is a pure example of how console partnership ruins games for pc, console has loads more features and just evident effort that they refused to put into the PC ""port"" its almost like they get more money from console users buying VC (in game currency that you can buy with real money) The whole ""my career"" playthough is a marketing skeem to get you to buy VC. They do this by making progression for your character â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ SLOW. You could probably hit 60 in classic wow before you even get half your badges.

The main reason I purchased this game was because it was on sale and there was a desire to have something basketball related be in my life routine. Due to the cancellation of the NBA season because of the ongoing worldwide epidemic, I was feeling a bit off from not having any new basketball media to consume for my entertainment. If it wasn't for those circumstances, I probably would have never even considered purchasing this game. However, with all that said, it does in fact fill that niche I was looking for. I don't have much aspirations with this game beyond playing against the CPU with some of my favorite players, so it accomplishes what I was hoping for."

The MyPlayer I feel like sometimes even though you run the offense perfectly it will find a way for your team to suck ass the whole game. Other than that it's a mayor improvement from the last one I played.The online is horrible like always if your player doesn't have a 99 overall forget about playing a fair game. Grinding is tough even in the best case scenario where you get the best rating pre draft and the best rookie salary it will still push you to buy some VC since it saves you hours upon hours of grinding for a decent player.

Earning vc through my career is very hard and going against ais are hard too. AI defense is too good, or maybe I am just really bad. Made a power forward who was good at post fadeaways and that move was reliable. That move only worked on regular role players, barely works on Giannes, AD, Embiid, Drumond, or any tier one center/ power forward. Also made a shooting guard, but can never get passed a defender. Again their defense is too good or I just suck. It sucks being a 60 overall going up against +75 overalls. Endorsements and endorsement bonuses help but the game is still very grindy. In order to reach (buy) your full potential you would need to pay for vc. To max your character you would need around 180,000 vc which is around $40. I am not saying that I want to start of as a 99 overall, but please give the players some free vc because you would have to put in hours of gameplay just to reach average. It took me about 11 hours for my PF to reach 71 overall and the game still sucks. My teammates miss wide open shots and shoots very contested shots, while enemy CPU always get green."

1089350,0,0,7.65612E+16,251,3,-1,71.4,"25 May, 2020","I should have realized what was up when I installed the game and discovered you can only play ""My Career"" online and logged in. (Ready to pay.)The scripted of the STORY are actually pretty good.  Pretty immersive.  This would be a plus were it not for the fact that it's a set up.I ground and I mean GROUND may way through the first 30 games of my rookie season.  If you help on defense, at all, you lose teammate grade for leaving your assignment, and it's harsh.  If you don't help on defense, the other team scores roughly 65% of the time while you are on the court.  I focused on staying on my defensive assignment, like the game seemed to want me to, and my player's +/- per 36 minutes played was -18.  The worst on the team BY FAR.  I tried to get assists, but discovered that almost every time I set up a team mate for a decent shot they either didn't shoot, made a needless move first thus negating the assist, or missed the open shot, in that order of frequency.  I attended every single practice and did max drills every opportunity, without looking in to what this does for you too much.  You slowly unlock badges and I know those help, and you also unlock general ""attribute upgrades"" as you go.  What are the attribute upgrades?  The game randomly chooses attributes for you and increases the cap on that bar.  The higher you raise your attribute bar, the more VC it costs.  So by grinding away and earning ""My Points"" you are increasing the potential for you to spend VC to make your player actually better.  How do you earn VC?  You get a set amount for playing games, you get a smidge for stats, (you get 2VC for making a bucket and raising your attribute one bar costs over 1k when the bar is high already,) and you get a chunk for winning a game, (good luck with the hand of God scripting that goes against you and the difficulty settings that  you can't lower, only increase from default,) and you get a chunk for the grade your teammates give you, based on how team oriented your play was.  (In other words, how much you didn't try to alter their destiny and just went with the flow.)  So after 30 games I had increased my overall to 79, and now the coach tells me I'm ready to start, benching a much better player.  I am stoked and go all in trying to play an efficient, team oriented game.  I get a tough defensive assignment but he only burns me about 3 times.  I get 7 assists by force feeding my open teammates at every opportunity.  I play crazy transition defense.  I don't iso a single time and get called out for bad shots.  I make a few last second buckets and go to the line a few times, scoring 12 on 56% FG.  I get more rebounds than normal.  I feel really good about the performance, (after all it was an A, which is rare for me,) and we win the game against a good team, at home.  I head in to the locker room, and....I apologize to the assistant coach, (the only staff member that actually ever talks to me,) with my head hung low, for ""letting the team down.""  I get blasted on social media for a disappointing start.  I have NO IDEA why.  I am stunned.  How could that possibly be bad?  We won, I got a team A, and I chose the team based dialogue options to max my team chemistry, and for some reason the game wants me to feel like I am inadequate.  Wonder why that is?  So I go to player progression to raise my stats a little, seeing as how I wasn't good enough to impress anybody after my best effort.  Turns out I had earned 1100 VC.  That was enough to raise 3 stats one bar each.  It did not increase my overall.I don't mind the fact that it is a serious GRIND to improve.  I actually like that long term sense of progression this sets up.  But the game shames you for not being good instantly, it stacks the deck to make it tougher on you than it should be, and the only way to change your fate is to pay real cash.So know that about My Career if you are interested in that aspect.  It's a trap.  Don't get the game just for that.  (Or actually, now that they knocked $40 off the price, right after I bought it....maybe go ahead and take a flier on it.)"

You can pay for everything with Virtual Coins that you need to buy for real dollars instead of grinding long hours to improve. MyCareer mode sucks so much it's unbelievable for 60$ price tag. You're given some cringey nickname ""Che"" that you cannot even change and can only choose a SECONDARY nickname. Why 2k cannot stop making up these foolish nicknames ? I remember in 2k14 you had way more opportunities than now. You could at least choose a nickname. Prelude is soooooooo long for a sports game. You spend like 40 mins in a row watching some cringey scenes then play ball for ~5 min and wait another 40mins. Also, draft night is NON-EXISTENT. You play a prelude that long pretending to try to stock up in the draft and eventually you just get to choose what team drafts you??? WHY?? FOR WHAT?? Somehow there is also an imaginary friend in the league that they keep talking about. WHY DOES HE EVEN EXIST ?? I don't care for him at all. This is MY CAREER LADS.Long story short the game is not worth a single dollar folks. Gameplay is just the same as in 2k19 and you better not waste your 60$."

For reference, I'm new to basketball videogames (Besides the NBA Jam series some 2-3 decades ago) so those that are frustrated with a lack of improvement since NBA 2k14 may be correct in their assessment.  I am just having a blast with my career, my team, (Idris Elba and Rosario Dawson and Thomas Middleditch?  Well, this is above and beyond what's expected from me).  The 3 on 3 games are fun.  The throwback teams are fantastic (Jordan v Lebron James?)Just a great time so far.  2 biggest complaints though are - Face scan with the nba app was terrible.  It took 20 attempts as there were constant errors with the app, uploading it to the servers, or downloading it to your game.  Eventually I got a very bad face scan that looks nothing like me.  I played 1 game online with 90mbps internet and got a juttery though playable experience.  It definitely stutters much more than single player, which limits my desire to play it compared to the silky experience offline.  If I had friends I would invite them over to play in real life.I mean.  I have friends.  But it's the pandemic.  It's not a lack of friends at all.  Yes.  And that's all I got to say about that.  9/10 Review based on 9 hours played.  PC is i5 9400 with RTX 2070 and an SSD.  Load times are slightly annoying, but not too bad."

It was a good career experience, enjoyed my time but to be honest it gets boring after about 60 hours. The reason is you are always listening to the same commentary while playing games, it takes a lot of time to start every single game and you aren't able to skip some animations. Also, everything is identical, you see this after your first 20 hours. It's hard to earn VC and you really need it. VC is in-game money by the way and you need it to upgrade your player's overall rating. I've played a few different nba games than this one and 2k20 is definitely harder than others, it is really hard to green release at the beginning, don't rage when you can't hit threes just get badges and check youtube for some tips. There are plenty of game modes to play such as MyTEAM, MyLEAGUE, MyGM, MyCAREER.I suggest you to play offline, there are always cheaters and legends in MyPARK. And you can't win games.Don't give 60 dollars or 50 euros whatever your currency is just wait for sale it's not worth for that much price.These are what you have to know before the main review, here it comes:First of all, I want to point out the graphics. They are truly realistic. This doesn't mean good, the game just looks real at all.I will not be talking about the other game modes but MyCAREER. You start as a college basketball player, then few things happen (i am not going to spoil) and you go to nba drafts. Everything goes step by step. You even choose the song to play when you hit a three if you come that level. A good story goes slowly, it always continues. I had my own designed shoes too. You basically will enjoy it. But the worst part is the gameplay. Don't expect to hit all of your shots or layups or free-throws. This game takes time to improve your build. You will not be able to get an A+ teammate grade every game. About bugs; there are minor bugs that won't annoy you while playing, you won't feel them. You need a pretty good pc to play without lags. These are all I can say, a good sports game. Wait for sale as I said before. A tip, get quick draw and range extender badges for shooting. Now I will link some screenshots and a bug from our game. Thanks for reading.An example of bug, I had 10 points but there's 8 belowhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2238873782LeBron's speech to us before entering leaguehttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2238871614NBA Champs, first season.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2238873461"

I had dropped 2K completely because the online modes have become Pay to Win and the online community has become extremely toxic. I had originally purchased this game for PS4, but now that I have a better PC, I decided to give the game another shot strictly offline and with mods.This game is totally fun and amazing with mods. But stay away from the online modes. If you want to just play MyLeague or offline MyCareer, then this is a great sim. The modding community has amazing mods for better player  faces and bodies, better courts, and better lighting / graphic enhancements."

That's another thing, you know your name, it's Che whether you like it or not, and it's the gayest name ever. gameplay in mycareer boils down to your dumbass team mates missing all of your assists and you getting blamed for everything. I swear the shooting system worked better back in 2K11, back then you didnt have to skip a cutscene every 4 and a half seconds. It's the best basketball game there is so it's kind of a must.

I've been a hardcore 2k fan every year and have always been one of the top players online. I have a fluid understanding of the game and all basketball mechanics.However, this year they have really screwed up the shot system and for some reason I cannot get the hang of the timing. I can't win any games and can't hit any jumpers even with wide open shooters. The reason for this is that the game makes it incredibly difficult to hit a shot unless you green bar the meter, even wide open. The shot percentage is like at 20% unless you get an all green bar meter which is something I can maybe do 1 out of 10 shots. everything else I can deal with, the clumsy ball handling, the poor AI . I can deal with that, nothing new. But when you can't make any shots wide open with perfect scoring shooters... there is a huge problem with the game. 2k is ruined for me forever since this is the direction they've gone down. I've played every year since the first 2k and I don't think I can play basketball again. I'm going to stick to strategy games instead of sports now. It's been nice playing with you over the years but I'm done"

This game gives you ample amounts of opportunities to spend more money than should be necessary thanks to its unfair, time-consuming, and tedious grind. I despise these practices and condemn these two companies.So why did I buy it?First, it just so happened to be on sale the very moment I was like ""I hope this is on sale RIGHT NOW otherwise I'm not getting it"". I've been desperate for some sort of NBA game on PC for quite some time. Second I've been desperate for an NBA game on PC for quite a while, and for what it has to offer in its SINGLE-PLAYER DIVISION, I am satisfied. Most single-player and offline features seem to be unaffected and untarnished by 2K and Take-Two's greedy clutches.

They will tell you about an investagation that is going on, and they will let you know about. Well.. let me tell you that's bs..in PC there is no real legeds, but in park you will find sometimes 13 of them.. big ass centers with max speed. So save your money and your time, is not worth it.

MAIN ISSUE: if your internet connection is interrupted, the game lets you play through and complete it, just to be met with a message that says something like 'NOT CONNECTED TO THE SERVER' and you lose all data/progress from the game you just played. This renders your last 30-40 minutes of gameplay NULL and is very annoying. I can't believe this hasn't been fixed. It would seem pretty simple to have data from game just played saved [briefly] onto an offline cache that transfers results of game played back on to your account once you reconnect to the serves. PLEASE FIX THIS!!! THIS IS SIMPLE AND SHOULDN'T STILL BE A PROBLEM!!! I've only had this game for a week and it's already happened to me 5 TIMES. Other than that, the MyCareer is a little better. I like some of the development they've done, but it also seems like you cap out on attributes quickly. It's like you start as a certain type of player and are inevitably going to be stuck in whatever build throughout (ie shooter, defensive, playmaker). Yes, you can improve your weakpoints, but not very much (from what I can see).MyTeam is GREAT. So many different player cards and amassed game modes inside of it.Again, overall a solid game, but 2K needs to improve on some things I feel are quite remedial to make the game feel whole."

I started play basketball when I was little and I AM a basketball fan but I could never play good, because I'm not tall and strong as my pals but I think of myself quick anyway. When I was in junior high, I spent my pocketmoney, and well, even some part of dinner money on purchasing basketball magazine and newspaper. The magazine launched out half monthly and the newspaper came out every Tuesday and Thursday but it's cheaper than magazine. It was from those juicy magazines that I started to obsessed with the trivia and gossip of NBA player. T-mac is my favourite, because he played with Yao Ming in Houston Rockets and he played gracefully. I started to play this 2k series last year (although I've acknowledged this game more than ten years ago). But I'll still need to buy a wireless controller for this game( I am using machanical keyboard currently which is good enough but...).  My team includes Dirk,Garnett,T-mac,Thompson and Barros, all are build-in player card which takes no money. This team is good enough to win a game for even ALL-STAR level, ignoring my bad keyboard operating skills.  I switch to Chinese version of  commentary(I'm Chinese) and it is sometimes very amusing, well at more time, they are very mean. The only excuse I allowing myself investing time on this game is that I AM a basketball fan. If I could found a way to cope with the unstable shooting rate, I will make t-mac get over 30 points in every game.  However, I've never won a game with the randomly matched online player."

1089350,1,0,votez,61,1,1,611.8,"6 May, 2020","Look, I could come at this from several different angles, but lets start here.  Have you played and if so do you enjoy NBA 2K20, or failing that, NBA 2K19.  If the answer is no, then the choice here is fairly simple, do not buy it.  Assuming you do enjoy or have enjoyed the NBA 2K series within the last two years or so, e.g., on console, then there is a lot to like here.  Assuming you are brand new to the franchise, I would say that whether this is a good game for you or not will turn heavily upon how much you loath micro transactions (or are willing to work around them) and how much you appreciate a sim type play style versus an arcade play style.  This year in particular tends much more heavily toward the sim side of that dynamic.  Micro transactions are a problem, but especially in MyCareer they can be avoided or at least mitigated in large part.   Using myself as an example, I buy a bit of VC at start of every season to ease the first grind (much like an MMO), then no more.  This isn't strictly necessary but your life will suck much less, because, make no mistake, park in 2K is a basketballl MMO.  Anyway, I suspect the main audience here is people who either currently play 2K or have recently on console and are interested in playing it on PC.  To that person I say this: The online community is much more vibrant than years past.  Predictably, game runs well on good good hardware, i.e., it will feel much more smooth if you have the right hardware."

After about a 5 or 6 game win streak in my Career, your next game will automatically be scripted for the other team to win. My player is averaging â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 70 points a game and yet every 5 or 6 games i have to restart multiple times because the game mechanics will blatantly be boosted for the other team and nerfed for you. All of the sudden your teammates will stop playing defense, the center on the other team inherits the block rate of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ manute bol and any third-string player can drain consecutive threes regardless of defense. Symptoms of a scripted game................ 1. your player runs right past the person your defending. 2. Unable to make shots even with minimal defense. 3. CPU getting consistant offensive rebounds. Usually after a well defended three 4. CPU scoring on 80% of possesions5. your teammates unable to defend their man6. CPU ability to score over well defended shots.7. CPU ridiculous help defense8. CPU ignoring player physics, going through my arm for a shot etc. This happens for all difficulties on MyCareerI maintain my playstyle consistantly throughout games and usually by the end of the first im up 25, yet every couple games, whether it be the lakers or the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ knicks, i cannot maintain a lead above 5, and the other team immediately goes on a 20-0 run as soon as im subbed out. If you still decide to buy this game some advice.1. After you go on a win streak for 5 or 6 games immediately restart your next game once2. During first round playoff games- restart twice3. for conference finals on-wards restart 3 times4. Dont play online, your buddies at Taketwo Interactive have offered up an extremely immersive experience this year where hackers are unregulated and players with 9 foot â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ arms run rampant in servers. If your lucky sometimes you get to catch a 100ft player.I know its bad luck to root for EA, but next year I hope NBA live gets their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ together and comes back because honestly if they made even a mediocre game they would wipe the floor with 2k. The fan-base is sick and tired of their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥."

A majority of the time your teammates will hog the ball regardless of how bad they are playing and continue to do so until they lose you game. You have to pay money to get to a higher level without insanely boring single player grinding.... None of the higher level players will play with anyone below level 85 or so.... I can understand not wanting to play with a level 75 or lower, but 80+? Come on man... I've played with lower level players that are clearly better than some higher level players. Some won't even play with people below lvl 90. Special players get the ability to ""boot"" you out of the queue to join a game which is absolutely nuts and totally unfair. Especially when you've been waiting a bit to get into a game and as it's about to start, some idiot boots you out and takes your spot... what kind of idiot thought this was a good idea? Oh yeah, the people who want a lot of these guys to feel special and important so they spend more money on the game... those idiots. The same ones who thought a casino was a good idea. What I hate the most is you are met with this INSANELY, obnoxiously loud helicopter sound the covers up every bit of sound in the game world and practically blows your ear drums out every time a Superstar joins. It's absolutely insane that anyone thought this was a good idea or even thought the sound of the helicopter should literally almost clip your speakers every time someone comes in. And to make matters worse, most of these people are hackers. If 2K actually put effort into making this game mode a good experience, it could actually be one of the best online sports games there is. But nah, lets just cater to pay2win players and put minimal effort into creating the game mode. Don't buy this game for My Park gameplay, and next year make sure you read up on how it works before you buy it. Always wait for the inevitable sale the game has every year as well... unless they do amazing work on a game, I always wait until the price drops to at least $20 and even that is too much. They used to do sales on the game for $8, but not really any more. Do not buy."

You want to get any, clothes, shoes, in game animations? VC! The grind to upgrade your character is ridiculous because you earn VC so slowly compared to how fast you can upgrade. Essentially, if you want to start a new Character and get them to around 85 Overall within 10 hours without glitches, be prepared to pay another $80. This game also seemingly (played through play offs 6 times now) purposely changes the way the in game play happens in the playoffs/finals with players seemingly gaining massive stat bonuses behind the scenes ruining how it feels.

The first 2K I have owned and I will never spend any money on any game from this company ever again(the quality of such a big franchise such as NBA 2K should reflect on the company as a whole).  You know how little effort and quality they put into this game just from how unpolished, glitchy, and lousy the user interface is throughout every single game mode or menu.  You would think that it couldn't get worse but then the unresponsive and buggy gameplay (especially online) just puts the nail in the coffin and is honestly the worst part of it all. The physics, mechanic, controls, and simply how the game looks as a whole is as if this company is trying to scam the people who are buying it.  Can't believe they charge consumers money for a product like this in 2020, but sadly there are no other options for people who want a good basketball game."

I realy wanted to like this game, but there is a huge downside to wich I will refer later. The game mechanics are fantatsic and once you get the hang of it, the game is realy fun to play. The graphics and player animations are pretty good as well. The possibility to scan your own face via your phone and seeing yourself alongside actors like Idris Alba is kinda weird and utterly mind blowing at the same time! Although the story mode was way to short and did fail on using its full potential, I would not have much to complain, if this game would not turn out to be an outrageous money milking machine. The progression system is so unbelievably slow, that you just notice how the developers have planned to get you to pump more money into the game in order to be able to upgrade your player properly so that the fun doesn't let up. These methods seem almost criminal to me and destroy the gaming experience in the long term. I am downright disgusted by the tenacity of the developers. If I had bought this game at full price, i would have been pissed to the fullest extend. 2K should be ashamed of ripping their customers off in this way!CONCLUSIONNBA 2K2020 is a fantastic basketball simulation infected with a disgusting and treacherous pay to win system, implemented by greedy companies which give the whole experience a bitter aftertaste."

Given that everyone knows this, they have made the game revolve around micro-transactions to stabilize their income rate (you probably knew this too). Save yourself the inevitable rage that will result from playing this worthless, garbage-game for more than 10 hours. I have to STRONGLY advise you against purchasing this copy/paste, low-effort, embarrassing, and enraging piece of addictive garbage. I would say this game has significantly worsened my mental state and contributed to the debilitating anger issues I have today. There is, as unfortunate as it is, no better basketball game, because god hates gamers who like basketball. If you invest hours upon hours like I have (been playing religiously since 2k16), you will find that the game does not reward, and rather, punishes by matching with noobs, who still have 50/50 chance of beating you due to the games inability to register skill and make it matter. The MyTeam platform is especially pathetic in that you cannot beat anyone unless you invest a minimum of $100, and even then you'll often lose to 12-year-olds who have spent thousands of their parent's money to acquire a ""god-squad"" that is virtually unbeatable. I have invested, as of now, 751 hours into this garbage. I hate myself for it and I've invested far more time into other games and didn't regret it as they were consistently enjoyable, as opposed to this RUBBISH. I genuinely wish death upon all the money-hungry head-developers, who have been using what is essentially gambling to trick children into wasting endless amounts of time and money. I could go on and on about how horrible this franchise is. I am disgusted. I am angry. Never before have I been more enraged by a piece of media than this. PLEASE DO NOT BUY! PLEASE! I beg of you! If you are considering it, STOP considering it! Go buy something fulfilling. I know you may like basketball, but this isn't basketball. This is VIRTUAL HELL!"

This game feels like a total chore to play. You should never miss an insanely open shot that any G League Player would easily make just because the game doesn't think you have enough ratings. I've been open so many times and missed a layup under the rim with a 7ft+ player for absolutely no reason. Your teammates in my Career are entirely retarded and cant setup anything. If your a new player against a star like Lebron, you have absolutely zero chance of defending them no matter how well you play it, simply because the game doesnt want you to. You get stuck in this horrible animations inside the paint constantly if you come remotely close to another player which results in tons of 3 second penalties. Its fun and easy before you get to the NBA but when you get in even if you bought VC and have 85 overall your absolute trash. The game itself is designed to make you feel like garbage until you grind badges and upgrade your OVR. I dont know how this series is the top of the line for NBA games. It feels like total sluggish glitchy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to play. Please don't buy this for your own sanity.

Expect to buy in-game currency worth 40 bucks before it becomes enjoyable or grind for 150 hours as a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ player. The game is also extremely unstable, with frequent crashes, extremely long loading screens of up to five minutes before you can enter the park area. A typical NBA game has many unskippable scenes making a single game take about an hour with only 25 minutes of actual gameplay. The story is non-existant with all your cut scenes being about your endorsements which are actually just product placements in disguise. The actual story completely stops after the prelude and is only hinted at. Also â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Dorris Burke as a commentator. She is pretty okay in actual NBA games but in this game she is just a nasaly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ who sounds like she doesn't give a f... When the game runs it's an amazing basketball game, but everything around it is just a scam and so poorly optimized for PC. I suggest, if you have it to use Synergy2K and play ""mycareer"" in myleague using a character lock. google it if you want to know more. I said this was the last 2k game I would purchase but I somehow broke and bought it, when the NBA shut down due to you-know-what. Never again until they make a better single-player experience as that is what I play it for.

MyLeague and MyGM (especially MyLeague) are the two best franchise modes in sports gaming today. The gameplay is as beautiful as ever! Some people say that the game seems ""slower"" this year. As in players move slower. If that's a problem for you, they have a slider for that....easy fix. I don't play the career mode, at all. Can't speak on it. From what I read though, it's at the very least many times better than Madden. That's not saying much though LOLI have heard horror stories, endlessly, about the multiplayer in this game. If that's what you're interested in I recommend staying away. I would never play a sports game online lol. The MyLeague and MyGM immersion is the best is the entire sports game genre to me. They have re-created every single salary and trade rule true to real life. You can change the way contracts are structured for players, back-loading them, front-loading them, evenly spreading them (although this feature has been in franchise modes for 2K for years now). Regardless, that isn't found in Madden or even The Show. I don't know about NHL games. The customization sliders for MyLeague are incredible. What a level of immersion.

I get drafted, play from the bench as a Rookie, I hit ""simulate to next appearance"" and nothing happens. Even worse, I have to watch the game play out in slow-motion. A game that would usually take 5 minutes (since I don't get a lot of minutes as a Rookie) takes about 30 minutes and I just sit there and can't do anything. This has existed since release. I hadn't touched this game in a few months, I had hoped that they might have fixed it, so gave it another try, Still the same issue, after months.Still unplayable for me after all this time and multiple patches.

The only thing players do is customize defensive settings and then let the cpu do the work because honestly you can't really control the players due to delayed input and lag. Most of the time the game will match you up with a team that moves 50% faster than your team and sometimes the other way around. I suspect the game matches you up to players with faster servers. Open shots are so hard to hit and even if a player is open for a shot, because of the lag defenders can recover so quickly before you release the shot which is insane. I decided to buy this trash game on PC because I thought the game will improve due to better specs and LAN internet connection but still the same crap game and same problems. I'm connected to a fast fiber optic internet connection  and also tried the lowest video setting but still the game is trash. 2K just ripped me off twice!!

1089350,1,0,Loghaire90,316,4,-1,395.3,"6 April, 2020",Another Nba 2k title where they changed little. Practically everything is copy pasted from previous Nba 2k title. AI is somewhat improved (I guess) but it still acts monumentally stupid when you're down points. Mycareer games become impossible and even make you question if the devs have seen any Nba games ever... Same stupid fouling and same animations from previous Nba 2k title and when you're down points the AI can't score again like previous games. When you're up points the game becomes tolerable and even enjoyable since you can score more easily and AI even behaves somewhat rationally. The Problem with AI is that it can't create consistently especially when you're down. No mid range shots are taken and it's always go to the basket and get contested or blocked or maybe it even gets one in. This is of course on your side of things. It's so tiresome how these that are supposedly based on a Team sport like basketball make the player carry the team and make the team incapable to run offence and make plays much less make plays that get you The player open. Mycareer also suffers from microtransactions where your player starts as a low level guy who somehow gets into the NBA without being able to play basketball at all. Your stats are so low that it's embarrassing and you having to carry the AI or just lose most games just forces you to buy virtual currecy to get better or grind and get infuriated. This game is stupid waste of time. Multiplayer is hardly any better the way it is handled. No communication methods in-game makes making a group in the park take too much time. Jordan rec center is at least a match making system but of course it's populated mainly by level 90+ players and limited number of lower level players sucking the fun out of that mode. Myteam is riddled with microtransactions with card packages you buy with real money and I really didn't care for it anyway.

Now, all three of us have a glitch where we no longer gain XP and our attributes are bugged and say -56 or some variation of numbers. We attempted some fixes and did some research and as far as we can tell at this point our characters are busted and will never move past their current level(89). If you have played NBA2K20 and haven't had this issue I sure hope you don't. Who really wants to grind back through everything again, spend a bunch of VC and then potentially lose it all to a glitch.

1089350,1,0,7.65612E+16,218,2,-1,47.5,"4 April, 2020","I'm giving up on this game because of its gameplay mechanics. For those who are not familiar with it, shots and layups are either beased on an individual percentage (each basketball player on this game has its own % chance of shot sucess) or based on a timing system (I'll explain it in a second). If you set the shot/layup setting to individual percentage, then you will face the game's RNG. If you set the shot/layup setting to timing, then you will face a tricky meter that charges accordingly to the time you keep the button pressed. Press it for a too short amount of time and it won't charge enough for the perfect spot (called a ""green release""), press it for a too long amount of time and it will exceed the perfect spot. It's tricky but at least it's fair. Well, only to a certain extent. There's one more gameplay mechanic which is much more annoying. Whenever you make a shot/layup, if there's an opponent defending it close enough, there's a HUGE chance you will miss that shot/layup. The game calls it a ""contested shot"". On the other hand if there's no opponent nearby, then it's called an ""open shot"". The problem with the contested shot mechanic is that it's not nearly fair when you play against the IA. If you are close enough to an opponent but you don't try to block the shot using the blocking action, it's almost guaranteed the opponent will hit the shot. However, if you are close enough and you do try to block the shot, then great are the chances you'll make a foul. The same goes for the stealing action. The unfair part here is that whenever the IA opponent tries to block or steal the ball from you, it rarely makes a foul. In the end, I feel that having good skills in this game are either useless by its randomness or shut off by its lack of balance."

I am playing MyLeague offline, and there are just dozens of plays in the game where my center is playing up at the free throw line while the man he's supposed to be covering is wide open under the basket.  I can't very well visually monitor 4 players to see who is out of position AND play defense on the ball, so it's just endless garbage points that don't feel like authentic.  It feels like the CPU player decides ""Ok, I need to catch up, so I'll just have the opposing team center out of position for 5 consecutive plays"".  Then if I try playing center and get him in position, the guy covering the ball handler just lets him blow right around him.  I know this is cheating, because it NEVER happens to my benefit.  It's just garbage lazy programming.  They needed a way for the CPU team to ""go on a run"", so the easy solution is just to have it cheat.  When you've played an entire 48 minute game, and the computer resorts to these cheap cheating tactics, it's infuriating.  1/10."

You cant do ""skip to next appearance"" in my career unless you turn on vertical sync4. Ai Team mates are deliberately forcing you to lose the game (my career)5. During fast break when your team have the ball your ai teammate deliberately waits for the opponent to block him before attempting to dunk the ball (my career)6.

The CPU players routinely make inexplicable decisions, especially on defense, and you will often find your team perfectly set defensively, only for one of your teammates to suddenly leave a 3-point shooter wide open because he wants to switch the match-up. This has been a problem since NBA 2k17, and I don't think it will change for a very long time.While I appreciated NBA 2k19 for the quality of the collisions, NBA 2k20 has gone backwards massively, and you will often see players going through each other. For example, you will see a defender's hand go through the ball as he's trying to block a shot (without a block registering), or you might find yourself in perfect position to defend, only for the ball handler to go through you and find himself wide open in front of the basket.The way in which the game plays is extremely unrealistic. All teams play exactly the same offensively, i.e. the ball handler gets the ball, he triggers some useless offensive motion, then sits around while the shot clock counts down and then shoots a contested jumper. Defensively there are only minor differences related to how they treat pick and rolls and mismatches.Hall of fame difficulty, just like previous years, turns your teammates into secondary school calibre players, unable to make even the simplest plays, like pass to a wide open teammate, knock down open jumpers (which especially applies to top tier shooters), and sometimes refuse to shoot an open layup in front of the basket, instead preferring to make 2-3 useless pump fakes, during which the defender gets back into position, and then air-ball a contested layup. Conversely, the Hall of Fame CPU is moved into a Godlike tier. Do not be mistaken, this does not mean they are smarter, or more skilled. They still trigger useless offense, and run around with no purpose, however, they just make impossible plays. There is the classic example of the heavily contested three as the shot clock winds down, but even if that misses, you will find that the HOF CPU will dominate the boards, and will have a 99% chance of boxing out the defending rebounder. This applies regardless of who is fighting for the rebound, so a player like Jayson Tatum will somehow manage to push Andre Drummond out of the way and grab an improbable rebound, then dunk the ball like Shaq.Instead of making the experience of playing on Hall of Fame fun and challenging, they just made it purely frustrating and unrealistic and I do not recommend anyone to buy this game, unless they wish to try other modes."

The Intro for career mode is quite neat in my opinion, though it feels a bit too long. I ran into a performance issue where the game was only able to maintain around 20-30 fps, and you have to do some tweaking to make it run properly. Overall, it's an okay game especially when you play it with someone else, just try and stay away from multiplayer if you can. I'd recommend it on sale, since I think it's quite expensive.

1089350,1,1,chollarman,102,5,1,251,"27 March, 2020","Presentation 7/10Presentation gets a 7 for me. The main menu isn't anything to brag about. No hyped intro video (2012 was the best). The NBA Pregame show is kind of nice for the first 20 games you play then it just gets repetitive. Despite all of these, the game looks amazing.Gameplay 8/10Gameplay isn't actually too horrible. My only gripe is that when you're at least slightly contested, you brick almost any shot you take. Sure with the default sliders, its basically impossible to make a layup with Rudy Gobert within 5 feet of you but taking the time to tweak sliders makes the game better. I can't name off the top of my head anything that constantly ruins my experience. Just a couple of weird 2k bugs that show up every once and a while. MyCareer/Park 4/10The myplayer builder is a great improvement in my opinion. It allows for so many different myplayer builds. The new badge system is nice because you actually get to pick your badges therfor create even more customization. The story at the beginning is alright but abruptly ends as soon as you start your rookie season. Summer League is pretty cool especially with the different commentators. After Summer League though, You're plopped into basically generic mycarrer. A couple endorsement cutscenes sprinkled in between but thats about it. The park is the same from last year. Same people heaving up bricks from half court, same people spamming steal with HOF pickpocket. Servers are laggy. In game items are way too expensive. Too reach 99 overall it's a GRIND without buying VC. I've been playing the same Mycareer for about 1 1/2 seasons and average about 10 minute quarters and i'm a 84 overall. Interesting side note: I play on a 144 hrtz monitor with v sync off. For what ever reason, I cannot skip bench time in mycareer unless i alt tab exactly 6 times. MyGM/MyLeague 4/10These are basically the same modes in my mind. One has a little more artificial customization but overall they're both just franchise modes. Everything goes pretty smoothly until you get to the draft. You can either import a custom draft class or deal with the WORST DRAFT CLASSES I'VE EVER SEEN. These dudes come into the draft between the ages of 21 and 26. I put the draft class quality to 100 and still had this issue. To my knowledge there is no way of fixing this and my only fix is to either pick the youngest players or edit the player's age which puts my team at an advantage over the other teams. After a couple of seasons, you realize that everyone is at least a 76 overall and every team has 4-5 players over 82~ overall. Bum free agents want upwards of 20 mil a year and players' moral drops for no reason. They complain about loosing games when the team is 26-3 and they'll complain about playing time even though they are starting with good minutes. Expansion teams are decent but don't have any custom audio for cities. Your arm sleeve color is locked at bright blue unless you go to each individual player and change their colors.MyTeam -/10I've put about 3 hours into my team so i don't think its fair to assess it's rating. From my understanding it's about as grindy as mycareer and it's 2k's other cash cow. WNBAGreat improvement, I havent used it much but it's still a great feature. My only wish is to put WNBA players against NBA playersConclusion2k20 is one of those games you have to buy on sale to make it worth your money. Pretty fun most of the time but has some game breaking flaws in MyLeague/MyGM. Overall, 7/10, would break your ankles again."

Starting out as a rookie and working your way up through the ranks of the NBA is meant to be tough, right? If you want to just jump straight into PVP you'll probably be disappointed. Even if you buy all the coins to max out your character, it seems designed to still require some grind to earn points and badges for levelling up."

BUT, the MyCareer mode if you play only the NBA is great, the people complaining about crashes is on there end... I have never crashed once playing 150+ hours of this, I crashed once when I tried to change some settings on my Nvidia Control panel, so one thing people can try is to go into their Nvidia settings and make sure that the NBA2k20.exe is set to restored or default settings, and see if that fixes the crash. NBA is on Pro level difficulty so the people that can only handle rookie mode, will get wrecked... my first week with the game, I was getting owned but persistence and learning the game mechanics made me avg a score of 60+ in any game on PRO difficulty that is, I am no Hall of fame level player by any means. The game is really amazing if you have the same skill level as me, because some of the matches were so heart pumping and realistic. I had a few games where I would be down 10 and the uphill battle to come out on top at the final 1 minute, was simply an AMAZING experience. I wish the PC community got more love, but the hackers make the online play impossible for me. Also, the console versions have a mode called MyPlayer Nation, I was looking forward to doing it on PC, but found out it is exclusive to the consoles version of the game only.P.S The park mode got me â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up in the beginning because they reset your camera, or the options for the camera is separate from your NBA game settings. To change the camera in the Park, you have to hit right on the D pad, and use LT, RT to cycle through the cameras. The park feels really weird to me compared to NBA and MyCourt.I would only buy this game on sale... I would never pay full price... This is a cash grab company and video game... everything in the game, you will notice that they try to maximize the amount of money they can get out of you. EVERYTHING COST VC, Upgrading your character, buying animations, clothing, and emotes. I understand spending VC for cosmetics and animations, but these animations also affect the gameplay as well... there is no balance in this game, if a player does their research to create an OP build you can save a lot of time, money and frustration... anyone new that picks up this game and creates their own build is at a disadvantage... I wasted my entire 100k VC from the legend edition on my first character, just to find out I made the most retarded dude in the world LOL. But hey, the games still really fun to play, I am just bad online. Definitely worth the 33$ I paid for the Legend edition. I calculate each Dollar, by the hour that I play a game for.

The game is damn near carbon copying from 2k19. Just updated rosters, the graphics don't even look that different, but that is to be expected in late generation games. Seriously though, if someone blindfolded me and said to guess which 2K I'm playing from 2019 or 2020, the only way I would find out from the menu's is the soundtrack. There are redeeming qualities to this game, however. The reason I do not recommend the game at full price is because its basically a money farm. You pay $60 for a barely changed game, that attempts to farm your wallet for VC. But I recommend getting it on sale, solely for the mods. There are amazing modders out there doing the work that 2K refuses to, and makes the game worthwhile, fun, and playable. I just wish we could mod better AI. Think hard about this decision. Probably more worthwhile waiting for the next one."

The game continues to stray further from a quality product and make baffling choices on how to ""improve"" their game. If you even want to consider buying this game, get it on a console. It's only worth playing with friends and even then it's a genuine toss-up. There are hackers littering every lobby in MyPARK and making it impossible to enjoy games. The badge system this year is a great improvement but does not make up for all of its pitfalls. Even worse, the game is so focused on online play and it is extremely difficult to enjoy MyCareer in an offline fashion. The Pay-to-Win aspect has been toned down this year but you can just win with hacking so whatever. I don't follow MyLeague that much but I assume they haven't changed much. Simply put, something massive needs to happen to improve this game. They continue to put out a low-effort product and get rewarded."

Put all their money into getting the Stars the talk about NBA 2K and don't fix bugs when it relates to player movement, layups are bugged always, and their MyPlayer system is rigged into coaxing you to purchase their version of bit coin, oh sorry VC, to improve your performance rather than fundamentals and actual skill and IQ reading the plays. They manufacture gamescripts where they purposefully reduce your ability to play in situations based on IQ and skill and force you into this feeling that you need to spend money to improve your player, or your build. I don't know why I continue to see the NBA stamp their brand on an inferior product like this, just like Shaq and that stupid ass Shaq-Fu basketball game from the 90's. When there was NBA Live, at least 2K was forced to compete to show that they had a better product, whether it was facial and anatomical rendering that pushed the industry, or a shot mechanic or dynamic mechanic such as use of the joystick to perform acrobatic layups. Don't get doped into supporting this company until they work on the bare bones of this game that are flawed to deep fault.

The 90 million cut scenes are cringe worthy and it won't let you skip annoying scenes or movements until like 10-15 seconds into the clip/animation. No way to turn off ""post score camera paning"". No way to change your POV in practice. Not player friendly. Might as well put un-skippable ads at this point.... During drills the helpers will pass the ball 5 feet out of the spot you're supposed to shoot in... man it's so bad. You can pick your player jersey.... but you can't see what the other team is wearing so you have a potential to pick matching jerseys....Also, note this game is super heavy on grind early on. The game wants you to do horrible. if you stick with it, you'll be able to drop 40 points a game like 25 games in, but it's still a pain, and you have to force it... I cut to the basket in the 2nd half.If you go off and get like 40 pts, 10 assists, 3 steals, 3 blocks, 10 rebounds.... your next enemy will play like Kobe regardless of their overall. You will also be constantly guarded off the ball and won't be able to move. It's so ridiculous lol. 70 overall matchup shouldn't drain everything.Unless you perfect time every shot, you will miss them. Badges make the difference. Make a 99 overall character and don't give him a single badge. He will miss every shot. Overall doesn't really matter for your player. The story is 3 hours, really annoying, and takes forever.I mean it's obvious that the company remakes the same game every year because they have no competition, but this one blatantly says, ""I don't care about the player experience. What are you going to do about it?"""

Generally, I've purchased sport games on console, but wanted to try it on PC and it was on sale for $20, so I gave it a shot ...For the most part, I was enjoying the fast load times and performance (compared to console) and then I started my MyCareer and got to the regular season after getting drafted. Now, I can't sim a game until I'm subbed in. When I try to the announcers go silent but the game doesn't skip ahead, meaning I can sit and watch a crappy 2K game for 30 minutes hoping I get subbed in. Good times. There are supposed fixes online, but pretty much all ""fixes"" involve removing any advantage having the game on PC may offer, such as locking the fps at 60 and turning on v-sync with a windowed display ...So, despite good gameplay and generally very good performance, I can't suggest anyone buy a game with one of it's best features essentially unplayable on PC unless you basically want to play the console version on a screen that's likely smaller than your tv.

Pulled the trigger during a steam sale, and boy am I regretting not grabbing it earlier. Gameplay is so good that it makes 2k unquestionably the best sports sim available currently in my opinion. The depth of offline is so extensive that i could go on endlessly, and MyTEAM isn't as P2W as the negative reviews would make it seem. I acquired a couple of decent players through grinding and I'm able to compete game in and game out with my opponents from simply being better at the game than them. Performance is solid on my GTX1060 laptop however i have noticed slight stuttering at times for brief moments, but nothing that ruins the experience. If you are on the fence about this game I would just advise waiting for it to go on sale as it frequently gets a massive price slash. Negative reviews from people with 50+ hours seems to stem more from salt than anything else. Can 2k make the game less grindy/P2W? Well obviously but the game is still good and therefore I'm going to recommend it."

The gameplay has suffered since the earlier games. There is far too much animation that goes into each movement making the simulation so slow. It seems like if you know all of the glitches in the game system, you can be a great player. the biggest killer to me though is the unnecessary animations. Players make completely unnecessary movements 90% of the time. The best thing about this game is the WNBA feature."

When creating a custom team, the sleeves are all always blue, regardless of custom team colors. This is a glitch in the 2k series for some time now, still not fixed, been around since 2k16 at least (2k16 is the last basketball game I bought before 2k20 - I don't buy the new version every year.). I had this game refunded on steam, currently only play single-player mode on xbox one. Multiplayer is unplayable due to bugs and cheaters that are never dealt with. Emails to 2k support are ignored.

The game is basically same as NBA2k19, where myLeague, myTeam and Quick Play have slight to no improvement. One  recognizable improvement could be badge system, but it is so broken that a lot of 60 ovr player have max badges at Park. 2k team never fix the delay in online myPark and have a poor matchup system in Rec center. Highly recommend not to buy 2k20 on PC since cheaters and hackers were everywhere in the server. I would say the badge system is a waste of time as 2k keep patching OP builds (stretch, BP builds)"

Honestly, the physics look realistic, the dribbling is crafty, and shots are hard to get, making you play basketball instead of 2K. Not so bad. H0WEVER;;; THE PASSING, PAINT, AND JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING ABOUT THE GAMEPLAY IS EXTREMELY AND TOTALLY STUPID. HONESTLY, EVEN PLAYERS WITH HALL OF FAME DIMER, 99 PASSING ARE COMPLETE AND TOTAL GARBAGE WHEN IT COMES TO HAVING A HINT OF AWARENESS AS TO WHERE THE F******* DEFENDERS ARE. ITS HONESTLY RIDICULOUS. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME."
1089350,0,0,7.65612E+16,17,2,-1,224.6,"2 March, 2020",First to put this slightly this game as a basketball sim is really good... on console. If you really want to invest time into this game get in on console but is this game worth it. To be completely honest to you. Only on sale. And it's still not worth it sometimes. And there's multiple reasons why. First there's no anti cheat.... So people are literally straight up making impossible builds but sometimes still being trash and if you want to try and cheat with them good luck finding a trainer cause the ones they're using are impossible to find and they all hide in a discord server sending each other the updated ones and if you try to buy it from them they just straight up scam you. Now aside from that the gameplay is good but not better then 2k19. And the parks at certain times can be â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ empty. Now that may seem good but from what i've experienced the park with alot of people makes the game sometimes impossible to play on and half of the 3 courts cannot be taken serious for me because on one side of the court it's literally a slideshow and impossible to play offense or defense. You expect a company with a alot of money to invest it on servers but you're as far off as saying NBA 2k18 is the best 2k game of all time. Now my main problem and ik it's part of pc but I've heard it's on console sometimes as well so i'll say it. IF YOU WANT TO PLAY SOMETHING OTHER THEN PARK GOOD LUCK. Rec is not even close to being alive and stage is just a cheater fest. And pro-am is not even to be heard. And also the events are mostly just total ass in this game. Main reason no one plays them. like 4v4.... it's literally dead. Now some events are worth it but you gotta wait till the weekend and again... cheater fest. Now I haven't talked about myteam a bit cause it's... alright rn. Haven't played much of it but if you're into it go for it. This review is mostly about the park. But one of the things I finally want to touch up before I finish up is MyCareer. I used to be a MyCareer guy back in 2k16 and 17 but now 2k is focusing too much on it for one reason. It's literally a way to bore you to the point of spending money. One reason it's bad is because you can basically score a triple double almost every game and the max you'll get out of it is around 1100 vc.... now it's decent but the main problem is the badge points. Badge grinding in this game is horrible. I've spent over countless of hours on my first build and i didn't get all the badges till near the playoffs. And don't get me started on the jumpshot creator.Now if i would like to sum it up i'll say this. If you have a console and 60 dollars buy 2k19. If you want to play 2k20 on console that's fine as well. But please spare yourself from this port. 2k has already shown they don't care about the pc community at all. But if you really want to get this game badly at least get it on sale. If you don't i'll make you suck a melon. Plain and simple/

When playing Hall of fame level, the game gets more mistakes. I love playing my career, but I wish the game was better. How is that it can't be created a player with more than 85 3pt and more than 85 Dunk. I had bought 2K since 2K7 and some things were better before. Some plays are too false. When attempting a dunk it changes to a bad layup motion because of a defender that is like 4 ft behind. I hate that the motions are forced."

1089350,22,7,darkmagi2,291,3,-1,34.6,"28 February, 2020","I don't often take time to review games on Steam, but this needs to be said. This game is a huge piece of garbage. I fully expected coming in that this would basically be a re-release of an old game with new rosters. That's just what these sports games are, yet people pluck them up for $60 every year.  I picked this up on sale for $20, so I was pretty tolerant of issues coming in. In short, this game is a nearly unplayable buggy Gatorade/Beats/Express commercial. Hell, for all the in your face product placement (way more than you think) this may as well be free to play. This review sponsored by Gatorade GX, change the way you refuel. Beats.Bugs:Here are just a few of the bugs you can expect to see: Seemingly random crashes to desktop at any given moment. Especially fun after you've played 30+ minutes of your MyCareer game and you lose all your progress.  If you set your refresh rate to anything higher than the 60hz default, then when you simulate to your next appearance in a MyCareer game, the game slows down to a crawl. It will not begin simulating until after about 1 minute of this and/or after you alt+tab a few times to ""kick start"" it.  Online neighborhood games are often a lagfest, and there is a constant underlying latency added to your shot timing. Essentially you need to completely re-adjust how you shoot when playing online. This isn't game breaking, but it sure as hell is annoying.Other comments:In fairness to this game, when the MyCareer isn't crashing, it's actually quite fun. You can tell they expect you to grind to become a half decent player, and that feels a little more heavy handed than older versions I've played. This is likely a ploy to get you to spend your hard earned money on more VC so that you can actually compete, but to be honest it didn't take that much work for me to get to an 80 overall, and with smart play you can still be a competent player. Also, all of my experience has been in MyCareer mode. I've heard MyLeague/MyTeam are fun, and I can't personally attest to how stable those modes are. But know that if MyCareer is what you are after, you are probably going to be frustrated.Honestly, for a game that does so little to innovate every year, you would think they would at least fix the bugs. However, they still sell every year without fixing anything so I won't hold my breath. I should note that when googling the random crash to desktop issue, I've found forum posts from NBA2K18 complaining about the same issue. Awesome.Final Verdict:Don't buy this POS on Steam. The PC version isn't stable enough for an early access alpha let alone a ""AAA"" release. If you must play this game, I highly recommend you get it on console. I assume it actually functions there."

Players on current rookie contracts have their lengths and ability to resign screwed up, causing you to lose out on players for nothing or not have a chance to extend them before they are a free agent.MyLeague players - save your money. They also made MyGM mode a ""ranked"" type mode so they removed a ton of customization options, even if you want to play ""unranked"".I am not a MyCareer or online player so I can't comment on those.EDIT: Forgot about another huge one.

On top of that, 2k is a company going to way of EA in terms of business practice and ethics. The fact that this game has passed ESRB gambling bans despite being filled with roulette wheels, slot machines and card packs/loot boxes seems puzzling until you realise that the chair of the ESRB and the president of 2k is the same person.Buy 2k18 and get a roster update, you'll have a better time."

Not only that, but the transaction side of things have taken a huge forefront in the game (which i expected but still disheartening). I was never interested in online, just some quick play games or running a season, maybe MyPlayer but even the menus have become cluttered and a catalogue of messiness. The timeouts and halftime performances and halftime shows and yadayadayada all just slow down the game and you can't disable most of it. If you could skip these scenes immediately it might be forgiven but you have to watch at least a few seconds of every once of these scenes and it gets so frustrating when you just want a quick bball game without all the interruptions. Think rocket league how you can jump in play a game and get out just as fast. A NBA 2k game is so bloated with all the simulation extras that it hurts the final product and even when I feel like playing a quick game, I don't since the bloat turns me off from trying. I bought it because it was on sale for $5 and that's the only reason. At that price I don't feel bad picking it up just to play a quick game every once in a while, but by the end of a game, even if I had fun there is ALWAYS some things that frustrate me with how this game is currently presented. The game has essentially become a tool to rip-off NBA fans as much as possible and the gaming has taken the backseat to those dolla dolla bills. Not unexpected, but still such a shame."

When I bought the game I intended to play MyCareer but a couple of things about this game mode that is just wrong. First you can't play offline even if you just want to play solo. That means that you must always have an internet connection. This is probably a way to deter cheaters and VC hackers in the game, as the devs can just ban you and you won't be able to play the career mode at all; this maximizes their profits from the numerous amount of microtransactions in the game. Which leads me to another point, your starting player is very bad, you can have a 85 shot rating and consistently miss wide open shots more than you will make them; even with the shooter build. I'm sorry but I don't see any real NBA shooter that misses wide open shots consistently like this game makes you miss. Your player can't defend, he can't score, he's pretty much useless until you get of a higher rating. Which would be fine, but the game gives you starter's minutes as a 60 rating going against high rated NBA superstars that will leave you with the impression that your player is moving in slow motion, it's just so unfun from an individual standpoint, yeah your team may win, but you're not having fun playing your character. Also the CPU will defend aggressively and constantly rip the ball from you if you try to do any kind of ball handling. The grind for VC is crazy, everything about this game mode is a grind. I'm just holding out hope for NBA Live 2021 or something."""

Went on to park, encountered a bug where the fps would drop to 30 and stay for a few seconds and come back to 60. This is proven to be really annoying since it's probably an optimisation issue that 2K is just simply too lazy to fix. I understand that they have to work on console aswell but can't we atleast get an optimised game? Would recommend if they fixed bugs (144hz sim to appearance bug, mild fps drops, crashes etc)"

When you play MyCareer, the only game mode everyone wants to play just to create your own player and go to the NBA or the park, etc. If you go to any team and you play the Golden State Warriors Curry and Klay will hit so many 3s that you will get angry, but when you decide to go to GSW suddenly everyone in the team becomes retarded, Steph can't hit 2 open 3s in a row, Klay can't do it either. Whatever team you go instantly everyone on it becomes a retarded player, taking stupid shots and missing wide open mid-range or 3-pointers.The thing about archetypes is also frustrating, you can't create a player like LeBron or MJ because if you can shoot and defend then you can't finish at the rim, if you finish and shoot you can't play defense. If you create a 7.0 post scoring center with a good defense and good post game then you can't shoot a simple mid range shot or freethrow.The most anoying thing about this is the lack of reallity in it, you post up with a 7'1 against a 6'10 with no defense whatsoever and you can't score on him, but the other way around he can posterize you every single time even with good defensive stats.2K needs to realize that people want to play good basketball and play with good teammates instead of playing with retarded players everywhere you go. They need to create a Story where your decisions count, because here whatever you decide in the story it will always end up in the same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥... I remember when you could choose between Universities and play for the one you choose, were you can take this endorsment or that one instead of everytime the same over and over again."

They ask you to redownload and re install 83gb worth of file so casually like it takes 1 min. You don't get to play MyCareer properly because you can't even Sim to your next appearance it all goes slow-mo and you have to alt +tab multiple times to see the button pop out. I have a decent PC so it doesn't have anything to do with my specs. A lot of people have problems with it but the supports just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.

This game's online modes (MyCareer, MyTeam, MyPark, and MyGM) are filled with them to the point of the game becoming unfun.  Anyone playing on PC online is basically hacking.  There are so many issues.  Yet it's the greatest offline sports simulation game in history.  MyLeague is worth 300 dollars.  Get it for MyLeague and learn all the stuff you can customize.  Arenas, Jerseys, an incredibly deep player customization system, playbooks, coaching styles, rotations, shot types including a shot creator, an entire new catalog of badge to make players unique and different, custom draft classes including the ability to import any draft class in the history of the NBA, player tendencies, player contracts, coach signings, an extensive training and mentorship system to develop younger players.  To top all of this off, if you don't like any feature there are 100s of sliders to fine tune everything from how teams value players in trades to how teams offer contracts.  It is the most immersive sports simulation in the history of sports.  If they keep MyLeague I will continue to shell out 60 dollars yearly.  The modding community also constantly puts out a slow but quality number of mods.  Get it"

Some pros first, MyCareer has another solid story-line, MyLeague is still enjoyable as you always have total customization of the team you are running, and the inclusion of the WNBA is refreshing and should be expanded upon in the future.Now for the cons, 2K totally wrecked the MyGM mode this year. It's tedious, repetitive, and boring. The constant chit-chatting and pestering for trades is annoying and the action points and skill tree concept is very flawed and limits a lot of your actions and you have to grind even more just to get to certain points. They need to make MyGM fun again because 2K18 at least offered a story-line without it becoming too heavy-handed and you still had a lot of customizations. This MyGM is just awful and isn't fun in any way. It's just a grind of talking and chit-chatting with your staff and players and it shouldn't take a long time to simulate through the season either. They totally killed one of the best modes with this new system which shouldn't ever be done again honestly.Other cons of course are more minor but 2K needs to allow us to permanently save our face scan to the game so it doesn't get lost easily and bring back Create-A-Legend in the form of something like MyLegend. I actually loved picking a random NBA player having a great career with them. So overall, I still enjoy the series but MyGM needs to be fun again at the very least."

But if there is one thing i can tell for sure after 120 hours of gameplay is that if you love NBA you will fall in love with this game. It's got to be one of the best 2k i've played ever.

(multiple PDs, Full diamond and PD bench, etc.) MyCareer is easy until 95, and its just gaining those last 4 OVRs that can be maaaybe p2w, but it's barley a factor nonetheless.""PC is the worst platform!""- The ONLY downside I can think of is less players, so less auction house listings. For me, Servers are the usual experience on all consoles, the lag is the same, I have yet to see a hacker in game, etc. Also another downside is no game chat, but if you join a 2k PC discord, this quickly becomes a non issue.BUT-The game has it's issues.

At first glance the game looks similar to NBA 2k19, but it's the details that bring this game apart. I'm still early on in gameplay, but I've noticed some key differences: speed and defense matters.For example, if one team has a quicker center that can hurt you a bit. I just played the Lakers and they took advantage of my slow center (Gillmore? from the All time Bulls). I ended up countering by putting Horace Grant in at center, but that only goes so far against the Lakers as they have so many weapons.There is also a 'player DNA' and 'create a player' in league mode in the front office tab.. nice feature.My Team is also enjoyable. The way you can upgrade key players and they have goals to unlock stars further skills (like Hakeem Olajuwon is the player I chose early on.)And if your wondering.. I haven't seen any advertisements in myleague mode and the game loads much quicker than previous years."

I bought the game at 50% off because I know their reputation and didn't want to pay full value... looking back at it maybe I shouldn't have even paid half.The biggest issue to me is the complete imbalance when it comes to shots. You can be wide open, but unless the shot meter lights up green (perfect release), the odds of the shot going in are little-none no matter player ratings. I get not every shot should go in, but it's at the point where it's completely ridiculous now. This happens with layups as well. And as far as CONTESTED shots go... yeah, good luck. Meanwhile the CPU seem to be able to drill shots from no matter where, even contested (to a lesser extent, like it should be with the user-controlled player). This is all especially true in MyCareer because your teammates will consistently force up bad shots or miss wide open ones and before you know it you're down 20.Ads are still annoying too, do we really need to sit through the players making their way to the bench for a timeout and then five more seconds just so we can see Gatorade pop up, EVERY TIME? And do we really need an express introduction before the game (not every game, but still)?The animations still seem clunky. When I try to steal my player sometimes goes halfway across the world, AI players will randomly dribble it out of bounds or back across half court for no reason, turning your player the other direction takes three years, etc. Not the biggest issue but something that could be improved (but lets face it, probably won't).Oh, and the support is horrible. Basically if you have a problem might as well just keep it to yourself and save time trying to find someone."

Back to my earlier statement, in case your not aware, I believe the max OVR you can go is 99. Getting to 90 to 99 will most likely take up around another 50 hours in my opinion.

There are too many core basketball principals that they failed on and it just looks sloppy, like the developers don't actually care. For example, the offensive screener in pick and rolls is idiotic and fails to cut to the basket, they often stop about halfway there even if the roll is wide open. Shot profiles for players is garbage too, guy's like Gallo get a wide open shot at the elbow, but choose to do a step thru lay-up from 5 feet out that gets contested and misses. It's also stupid difficult to pull-up/spot-up right on the 3 pt line, you always run about 6 inches past it and take long 2's, which is super aggravating. Guys like JJ and Danny Green always run past the 3 pt line and take long's 2's as well (even as CPU), and it's just idiotic and lazy coding. Pisses me off thinking about it.-Update  30 hrs later. These developers should be put in jail, but I love bball and can't stop playing despite the rage it brings."

MyCareer mode as a few dumb things in it but overall an improvement i liked last years choice selection circle better than this year because if you skip through the a part that has a choice it auto picks the first choice in my experience. Skill boost are used in prelude games and since you have to play games the first time you start MyCareer it is a bit unfair. Camera angles in prelude games change from game to game from the one i set. I find without a few defense badges it is next to impossible for me to stay in front of any player even if i turn on the ai assist to max. Scoring is stupid easy in this game if your a slasher and the ai seems clueless on the fast break and worse of all at random defense assignments change at random sometimes but there is a slight improvement to defense mainly you actually contest shots now even if your not assigned to the person so a huge improvement compared to the last few games. I do prefer the new sim process when your player is on the bench because before sometimes you would be up 20 you sit and within a minute of game time you were somehow down 10 so i like that you can watch it or just spend an extra second just to skip like normal but i will add sometimes it seems like the new simulator gui or the simulator itself not a ton of points ever get scored even when 15mins of game time pass a few games i've seen a total of 30 between the 2 sides  in a half  and other times its like 30 points in within 4mins so if anything it just seems really inconsistent."

1089350,1,0,7.65612E+16,20,2,-1,173.7,"25 January, 2020","MyCareer Introduction | This game is horrid, I initially got the game for MyCareer however the game mode is terrible, once you enter MyCareer you have to either watch a 45 minute movie with loads of cut scenes or skip them all. The story isn't that great either so I wouldn't advice sitting through it all. One thing that stood out was the Combine, you are tested on your mid range, your catch and shoot, vertical height, etc. These tie together nothing and have no correlation to your player other than you possibly getting an upgrade in your draft projection. I only sit through those excruciating parts to get an extra 750 VC instead of the regular 500 if you were to skip the draft.VC/Money Hungry Devs | Speaking of VC you are practically forced to spend money on the game, especially if you want to play in MyPark/MyCareer. I average 1500 VC a game on 12 minute quarters, and full incentives. To upgrade some of my stats to max (95) I would have to sit and play 24 games. That's just for one. Single. Stat...The prices on the VC are ridiculous, to get a fairly good OVR and a good character you need to spend $50.00 on VC, Unless you want to sit and grind for 30+ hours on each character you create.MyCareer Gameplay |The AI is terrible, you are forced to be selfish and get a low Teammate Grade, for example, I play on the Warriors. Stephen Curry one of the greatest 3 point shooters of this era will miss a wide open catch and shoot 3...consistently. If you aren't being selfish your team will chalk up misses upon misses. Each game feels repetitive the AI will run the same exact play system. When I set screens for my teammates they will not run through the screen to catch a defender and make an easy 2 pointer/ 3 pointer. Whilst the other team will go through the screens and run straight to the basket for an easy 2 pointer. When I switch defenders on screens I will still get a ""Defensive breakdown"" when I'm clearly trying to cover someone else to make up for my teammate who got caught on a screen. These are just some of my main complaints, I could go on and on about animations, waiting screens, Questions etc. etc.MyPark |Now this could be my PC or the game itself, but inside MyPark it feels like everything is delayed and my frames are super jittery. The whole gameplay even with a controller feels delayed and clunky. Not to mention the toxic builds and the tryhards on the court. As well as the hackers/exploiters. It's so predictable the builds on the game, Glass Cleaning Lock Down, Slashing Play maker etc...You will wait ages for games, and when you do you'll get terrible teammates. It's fustrating as a whole and the clothing in the game is overpriced as well (Not looking like a bum is also very important) Other Online Modes |Other than MyPark I don't play any other online modes, especially since I don't know how to/Don't like them. But also you will rarely be able to find a game. I can't comment much on theseOther Offline Modes |I'm sure there are ups and downs on those modes however again can't comment on them as I do not play them.2K as a whole |It's a very greedy and bad company that doesn't listen to it's community. It instead destroys it by taking out certain things that everyone liked, inserting things that no one wants. And â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ over the community as a whole they are greedy liars who say they will have things in upcoming games and either lie or shy away from the fact that they didn't whole heartedly mean they would add 'this' instead they added something like that but very different that no one wants. In summary this game isn't worth your money if you aren't prepared to deal with toxicity and paying loads of money to make you have a better time and allowing you to play the game in the first place without ragequitting and deleting the game."

Especially when you think you are about to make a sweet dunk on the fast break only to bust out with the ever-so-flaccid lay up. Overall, My ignorance toward the fundamentals has created a fun learning experience for me....The Post, Lanes, Point Forwards!!!  Idris Elbow is a weird addition to the game, as I only recall him from a movie where he played a pedophile African rebel warlord.  Why not put Marv Albert in the game attacking female fans in the background?I do enjoy their take on Hawaii Leonard's disposition and Shaq's incoherent screeds.Worth the $8, I suppose.NBA action....It's fantastic."

It's one thing for a business to focus on making money. This is obviously, fundamentally, what businesses do. However, this is absolutely shameless.The worst offender, by far, is MyCareer. This is a single player game mode in which you're not allowed to choose a lower difficulty from what the game treats as ""normal"", where your progress is slowed to a practical halt because if the progress were reasonable, people would have little reason to invest in VC and other microtransactions, and more.

And it doesn't matter how contested they are, the AI on the other team can make 3s, but when I designed myself to be a pure shooter, a wide open 3, 1 foot behind the line doesnt go in even though the shot meter is essentially full but decides to not green light. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, never â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ playing it again.

However the constant crashing, the sim to next apperance bug not working, the really crappy name ""che"" the over use of the reporters constantly asking questions and the fact that if you try to play defense you get fouled out and trying to guard slashing guards is impossible since your guy will be fatigued in the matter of minutes of play time.

L'Asie du Sud-Est, une partie de l'Asie et le mystÃ©rieux joueur de l'Antarctique et les joueurs d'Afrique du Nord doivent monter un VPN. En ce qui concerne les novices qui ne savent pas grand-chose sur le processus de jeu pour la premiÃ¨re fois, je rÃ©sumerai briÃ¨vement. Si vous Ãªtes un joueur dans une rÃ©gion qui a besoin de monter une connexion VPN au serveur, je vous suggÃ¨re de choisir des logiciels payants rÃ©guliers, tels que Tencent Acceleration en Chine et Netease UU. AccÃ©lÃ©rez, 8LAG Buka accÃ©lÃ¨re. Le Japon et la CorÃ©e du Sud peuvent Ã©galement choisir 8LAG.L'Asie du Sud-Est et l'Afrique du Nord recommandent d'utiliser le plug-in VPN officiel lancÃ© par Google, mais le prix est trÃ¨s cher et la derniÃ¨re version de la ressource est difficile Ã  trouver. Un autre problÃ¨me concerne les mises Ã  jour de tÃ©lÃ©chargement rÃ©cemment publiÃ©es. Si votre barre de progression de tÃ©lÃ©chargement a Ã©tÃ© bloquÃ©e ou bloquÃ©e quelque part, il peut s'agir des problÃ¨mes suivants: 1. Votre NBA2k20 et votre dossier Steam ne se trouvent pas sur le mÃªme disque systÃ¨me 2. Vous n'avez pas montÃ© de VPN, d'accÃ©lÃ©rateur ou l'accÃ©lÃ©rateur n'a pas Ã©tÃ© chargÃ© correctement, vous devez redÃ©marrer l'accÃ©lÃ©rateur ou l'ordinateur 3. Il se peut que votre espace disque soit insuffisant, vous devez ajuster l'espace disque. Il existe d'autres situations qui peuvent ne pas Ãªtre exclues, veuillez utiliser votre ordinateur local Les moteurs de recherche trouvent des causes et des solutions.ZusÃ¤tzlich zu dem verdammten Server-Problem wurden ungefÃ¤hr 95% der anfÃ¤nglichen Fehler behoben. Abgesehen von der aktuellen Situation der NBA in China, die etwas umstÃ¤ndlich ist, kÃ¶nnen chinesische Freunde sicher sein, dass Europa, Amerika, Australien und das sÃ¼dliche Afrika Spieler mÃ¼ssen kein VPN bereitstellen, um eine direkte Verbindung herzustellen. SÃ¼dostasien, einige Asien und der mysteriÃ¶se Antarktis-Spieler sowie nordafrikanische Spieler mÃ¼ssen ein VPN bereitstellen. Wenn Sie sich in einer Region befinden, in der eine VPN-Verbindung zum Server hergestellt werden muss, sollten Sie sich fÃ¼r kostenpflichtige Software wie Tencent Acceleration in China und Netease UU entscheiden Beschleunigen, 8LAG Buka beschleunigt. Japan und SÃ¼dkorea kÃ¶nnen sich auch fÃ¼r 8LAG entscheiden. SÃ¼dostasien und Nordafrika empfehlen die Verwendung des offiziellen VPN-Plug-Ins von Google. Der Preis ist jedoch sehr hoch und die neueste Version der Ressource ist schwer zu finden. Ein weiteres Problem betrifft die kÃ¼rzlich verÃ¶ffentlichten Download-Updates: Wenn Ihre Download-Fortschrittsanzeige hÃ¤ngen geblieben ist oder irgendwo hÃ¤ngen geblieben ist, kÃ¶nnen die folgenden Probleme auftreten: 1. Ihr NBA2k20 und Ihr Steam-Ordner befinden sich nicht auf derselben Systemfestplatte 2. Sie haben VPN, Accelerator nicht gemountet oder der Accelerator wurde falsch geladen. Sie mÃ¼ssen den Accelerator oder den Computer neu starten. 3. MÃ¶glicherweise ist Ihr Speicherplatz nicht ausreichend. Sie mÃ¼ssen den Speicherplatz anpassen Suchmaschinen finden Ursachen und LÃ¶sungen.In addition to the damn server problem, about 95% of the initial bugs have been fixed, so except for the NBA's current situation in China, which is a bit awkward, Chinese friends can rest assured that Europe, America, Australia, southern Africa Players do not need to mount a VPN to connect directly. Southeast Asia, some Asia, and the mysterious Antarctica player, and North African players need to mount a VPN. Regarding novices who don't know much about the process of playing this game for the first time, I will briefly summarize. If you are a player in a region that needs to mount a VPN connection to the server, I suggest that you choose regular paid software, such as Tencent Acceleration in China and Netease UU Accelerate, 8LAG Buka accelerates. Japan and South Korea can also choose 8LAG. Southeast Asia and North Africa recommend using the official VPN plug-in launched by Google, but the price is very expensive, and the latest version of the resource is difficult to find. Another issue is about the recently released download updates. If your download progress bar has been stuck or stuck somewhere, it may be the following problems: 1. Your NBA2k20 and your steam folder are not on the same system disk 2. You did not mount VPN, accelerator, or the accelerator was loaded incorrectly, you need to restart the accelerator or computer 3. It may be that your disk space is insufficient, you need to adjust the disk space. There are other situations that may not be ruled out, please use your local Search engines find causes and solutions."

The second you play anything other than gm or quickplay or career, the servers decide that maybe they shouldn't work. All games are full of lag. Comparing the ping to other games, this is one of the worst of all time. Its such a shame that this game didn't do well. They have every component needed in a good game, just terrible online experiences mixed with lag, hackers, and exploiters that all just find every possible way to cheat instead of being good at the game. Buy it for solo play, Don't touch this with a ten foot pole for multiplayer. (After playing predominantly MyTeam as well as some GM, Quick Play Online, and Career) This game is 100% pay to win in MyTeam due to both the fact that you can buy a literal all 99 overall team combined with their awful, and I mean ET video game awful, servers. Online play feels like running with a parachute, no matter how fast or well you do something, you will never be going at full speed. My last online game, the servers actually made the game feel like they were going in slow motion. At first I thought it was frame drop, but after checking, I was at a full 165 the entire game. If you are thinking about buying this game at this point in time, save your money and just walk away. Take Two Interactive is one of the most money hungry and just downright abusive gaming companies in the world. If you want a basketball game just buy an older version of 2k, oh wait nevermind, they're all 60 dollars too and they don't even come with the servers online."

I'll be like 2 feet away trying to dribble and the game will cheat and slow you down and allow the defender to drain your stamina / etc. They also haven't bothered to fix the game predetermining if your shot will go in or not in my career nor have they fixed â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ AI teammates because EA likes to make you grind more and debuff your potential stats because it's a cash grab. I hate EA and Ronnie for this bs.Just tried playing another match, the defender spams steal, I can have the ball protected and he'll somehow reach across my body and strip it. God help you if you play against any AI with any defensive stats. The game will cheat you out of everything even if you have badges for the plays you're trying to make. Then on def it'll move you out of the way when the AI drives. You can be positioned perfectly and it'll â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ move you out of the way and let the AI green when you timed the shot contest perfectly while placing perfectly.

The multiplayer on PC is basically dead unless you're playing during a peak 2 hour window, and even then, you end up playing the same 20 people over and over again.  I'm not a big fan of the community either.  Discussion forums are also dead, but I think that has a lot to do with mods removing a ton of threads.

However, just about everything else about this game is cancerous. And unfortunately, there are simply no other basketball games out there that can compete. As many reviews mention, the game is designed to encourage you to buy in-game currency. I knew that going in and was willing to look past it for the sake of the game-play. However, this year's 2K CRASHES ALL THE TIME. I have a top of the line rig. I know it is not my computer. A few crashes here and there would not bother me, but this has been consistently crashing for months. What's so brutal about the constant crashing in both MyCareer and MyTeam is that you lose your valuable in-game upgrades like skill boosts and gatoraide boosts for your MyCareer player. (which are expensive AF in game) And in MyTeam you lose your entire line-ups contracts. The contracts in MyTeam are bad enough and I hate them so much. But losing these valuable commodities due to crashing is simply the worst. There are days I can't even enter MyTeam or MyCareer modes because it insta-crashes. They push so many damn updates to the game and provide little to no feedback as to what changed or why. They have no problem pushing out new packs to purchase every week in MyTeam. But game stability??? â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THAT.  Last year the servers were a nightmare and everytime a lockercode came out the servers would crash and you would lose your lockercode or those in-game purchases I was talking about. This year, servers are better but game just crashes.....so we're right back where we started. You know this greedy ass company makes tons of money off this game. But its pretty clear they give zero â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about the PC version. Some of you may remember they even had the 2K19 logo still when they first released this game. Buy this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on sale at your own risk. Only really good for the MyCareer solo play. MyTeam is impossible to compete online because its extremely pay to win. I've also heard cheaters run rampant. :)"

It was designed as a cash grab by 2k, without the ability to CHEESE my career, and the neighborhood. If you are a casual player, like myself, you will find MyCareer to be frustrating, but also far more rewarding without the ROOKIE Level of Difficulty that has been seen in years prior. That being said, this game is also one of the better 2k installments for gamemodes like My League or My GM. The gameplay also is as smooth as ever. If you are a casual fan of the NBA, or a die hard fan, you will have fun in this game, so long as you treat it as a grind when you play My Career."

If you are looking for a next level NBA gaming experience dont even bother with this game. NBA 2K has not changed since 2K13 only difference is a few controls and game modes. I would only recommend this game if you are like me and have not played NBA2K in years (last one i played was 2K14). If you have children i would keep them away from this game because of the microtransactions. This game has a literal casino with slot machines, and really wants you to buy VC. I know a couple of people who spend about $10-$25 a week just buying VC for MyPlayers, this means going into online modes is pay to win and unbalanced. This game also runs really bad and has bugs that have never been fixed since day one. If you run the game above 60Hz there is a good chance the pause menu and simulated events will just not work. Sidenote: If you encounter the MyCareer bug where the ""Sim to next apperence"" does not work you have to Alt+Tab like 6 times before it will work."

My player mode is really fun to play. However, it loses connection all the time and there is no option of playing it offline. I tried everything suggested by the 2K website, tried different computers and nothing worked. In the rare times where I am able to connect, the game is disconnected at the end of a game so I lose  all progress. This is really frustrating. It is really mind boggling how 2K can prepare such a good game and offer such a terrible gameplay experience."

There is a lot of stuff in game that is reused from last year and or the year before. The playground is literally copy / pasted from previous years. The entire game is geared toward getting you to buy their virtual currency, VC, in order to get anything done in game. Want to spend all the attribute points you've earned to level up your character? Impossible without buying a ton of VC or grinding an entire season and even then you won't have enough VC to spend all your points. Want clothes so you don't look like a newbie scrub in the park? The prices of clothing is INSANE. Literally 20-30$ of real money just for 1 shirt. Same thing for gear to make your player look more authentic in league games with elbow pads, knee pads, shoes, headbands, etc. all WAY overpriced. 2K's Lead promoter Ronnie2k stated before release that the park was different this year AND that you could respec your myplayer saving you a ton of VC, yet upon game release NEITHER was true. This guy has a HORRIBLE reputation in the 2K community. Also there are numerous bugs that still exist that have existed since launch. Pretty pathetic.This game could be amazing and fun for everybody if they DRASTICALLY toned back the need to buy in game money. They REALLY need to add the featrure mlb the show has where you carry your myplayer from game to game each year."

It's an overtuned pile of dog poo.Locked into Pro difficulty or higherWhen you get subbed the computer goes on 10 point or more runs.One little skill move by you or when bodied by defenders, that stamina bar melts quickly.Meanwhile the opponent AI, runs thru and around screens full speed with no fatigue hit or slow down.When you get screened whether a big or small guy, you're character flies feet away or gets stuck.When you screen you barely bother the NPC, and it's teammate covers instantly.The computer does not miss free throws 9 out of 10 times even if that player sucks in real life.If there is a big even 5 feet from paint you are getting contested on drives.I could go on and on about how the AI is superman and you are high school scrub.I don't play online so can't comment on that. I only got this for a xmas present cause it was on sale. But I think this was the last straw. Sale or not, I will not be getting future NBA2ks until I see raving positive reviews across the board and all this MT and overtune crap is gone. Hopefully EA makes a better live and on PC next year. They are probably no better than 2k if they had no competition. But competition will keep both in check somewhat.

I only played my team, and it's been much much better than 2k18's. There are so many challenges and different game modes that make the play time of this mode way longer and more fun. It doesn't force you to spend either, because there are some players that are sapphire, amethyst, or even diamond that go for 2k or less my team points in the auction. Really no complaints there. Gameplay is much slower than in 2k18, but it makes it a bit more realistic that way. Jump shots are slower but i noticed that it isnt affected by weak defense, unlike in 2k18 where the weakest of D would throw your jumpshot off. Anyways, im recommending this because of the My Team, which i think i'll be playing more often than any other mode. I know there are issues in terms of myplayer or the my gm, but if you can snag this at sale price and dont really plan on getting 2k21 at launch, go for it."

1089350,0,0,xxMoose,389,22,-1,277.7,"25 December, 2019","A lot of this game's (and series as a whole's) problems are rooted in how the animations flow and the success of certain animations that are practically nonsensical.Beyond that it's insistence upon itself while also having a higher and higher hill to climb to obtain VC for your myPlayer every year is just more and more ridiculous.updated jan 31 2020: This game, while having some interesting things that differentiates itself from 2k19 and previous 2k entries, brings A LOT of terrible balancing issues and bugs to the forefront.The developers are more interested in adding more items that you have to purchase in game currency for (or grind out game after game to afford them) than they are of fixing these bugs.If you play with sim stats on, like i do, simming a partially completed game will result in ABSURD statlines for your players. For example I just simmed a game i had 3 minutes left in wherein Robert Covington hadn't scored a single basket, looking at the stats after the game he had dropped 25 points. I looked further and what would have been 6 minutes left in a game resulted in ~25 points for both teams. In a blowout game with that little time remaining that's absurd.In myplayer when you play full length 12 minute quarters more often than not, the opposing team will not call timeouts. you'll end up getting games where you are forced to call time outs to replenish your players stamina to keep going, just the other day with 1.5 minutes left in the 3rd quarter my team, who held a 20 point lead had two timeouts remaining whilst the other team hadn't called a single timeout yet. Really? come on. How are you gonna call yourself a basketball simulator when little tiny things like this are ALWAYS popping up.The Drills you run to gain XP points towards your badges are often riddled with â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Often times you'll be doing what they ask of you only to be hit with an X and not getting points towards completing your drill.I'd only recommend getting this on a deal, don't give 2k more money than they are owed. The only thing this game has going for it is that it is somehow still better than the NBA live games.Update 4/22: I continue to play this due to my love of basketball. I can only suffer a game or two at a time before I get enraged and turn off. new gripe though: I have had to repair the installed files now 4 times total in the 4 months I've owned the game. Every now and then i experience a bug where it will not show me menu icons so i have no idea where the cursor is at. this will not be fixed unless i verify the games files. I have no idea why it's happening but considering this is a 60 dollar AAA title, I don't think this should occur, amongst all the other ridiculous bugs here and there.another bug that's been pissing me off lately is that when you succesfully challenge a call, the camera will stay on the coach until about a second or two into the live ball. Therefore, if there is a tip ball or free throws, whatever, you cannot see what you are doing until the ball is live. From a TV immersion standpoint? sure, neat, who cares, but in pivotal moments this can make or break a game. so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥."

But, if you are looking for fun single player action, or play with a friend, this game is excellent. They took out a bunch of the BS that made 2k19 miserable. The MyTeam experience is back on track and easy to get into. You don't have to play online at all if you don't want to. Lebron's production company helped out tremendously this year. They copied the dreaded EA Madden franchise in every way, but it's simple, and it's easy to navigate and understand objectives. Honestly, I should have paid the full price when this game launched. The MyTeam market is saturated, and the MyCareer story is fun enough to get into. For a discounted price, this game is excellent."

But I gotta admit, I have played this game (mostly MyCareer) a lot and enjoyed it more it than I expected. Despite that, there are some glaring issues that need to be fixed.These are just some I can come up of the top of my head:- Whenever you set the refresh rate above 60Hz (for example 144Hz, or in my case, 240Hz), it causes a game-breaking bug where, in MyCareer, you cannot skip part of the gameplay (simulate the game until next appearance) when you get subbed out. You have to basically have to sit and watch your A.I teammates play for 5-6 minutes every game. There are some workarounds, set the refresh rate back to 60Hz (which kinda suck cause I bought this game to pay in high refresh rate) or ALT-TAB several times until you can sub in.- This game constantly crashes on my PC. I tried everything, re-installing the GPU driver, re-installing game, checked for missing game files, change in-game setting, updating windows, nothing works. My PC Spec is far above the recommended requirements (3900x + 2080ti).- The game is basically the same as 2k19, same engine, same graphics, just a little upgrade on the User Interfaces.- You can basically pay-to-win on this game. It is filled to the brim with micro-transactions.- You cannot access MyPlayerNation, 2KLeague and Ruffles rewards on PC Versions (Unlike the ones on consoles)In conclusion,NBA2K19 V2 is not worth 80 CAD. Don't buy it (unless it's at least 95% off). You can get a lot of burritos for $80"

I havn't had any issues as of this review and I am 60 hours in.  It's the best story line so far, or at least in a long time.  This is my first time playing it on PC and I must say I do not think I will go back to XBox for 2k.  Game runs really smooth, the player builds are fun and I just feel like this is a great game.

The MyGM is also cool to play and very rewarding if you do it correctly and actually know what you're doing.From the Online POV the game for me is pretty much a 2/10 and I don't give it a 0 because sometimes you find a good enough server to play on and it's pretty cool to play online. Most of the times you get matched up against 10+ levels of overall rankings with a laggy server against a dude that literally has almost a team full of galaxy opals (TOP Level players basically, above 99). I'm from Portugal, I played CSGO, Squad, R6S and any other MP games and never had a laggy server to play on and on NBA 2K20 looks like only 1 out of 7-8 games you play with a decent server ping wise and against an equal or almost equal team on the other side. I mean if you're into spending money on the microeconomy stuff and GAMBLE if you can win or not because of the garbage servers, be my guest but as for me I won't play more MP since it's just pointless.Offline gameplay --> 7,5/10Online gameplay --> 2/10So if you enjoy offline and don't really care about online stuff buy it, otherwise don't bother."

The only reason I play it is because there is no other current NBA game to play. I would say roughly 50% of the time I load the game, it crashes before I ever get into an actual game of any sort. This makes grinding the game miserable. These crashes are unlike any I have seen before too, because, at least for me, when the game crashes, it doesn't fully close out. So, I can't re open the game until I force shutdown my computer, because the Windows 10 shutdown won't even work. The once great, and still best part of 2K is MyCareer, and it is now also the most poorly optimized part. The one thing I actually want to play in the game is the part that crashes the most often and suffers the most technical problems. Not to mention, the security must be horrible, because I would be suprised if there wasn't more than a couple hackers in every neighborhood online. I'm not even going to talk about the gameplay, because it is just meh, nothing more, nothing less."

It's obvious that it doesn't go away, so this time I write about the game itself.I use to play My GM a lot. I have finished a 5 year My GM play through with a top 20 global score. With the VC earned I would then play a My Player career. This would give me some VC to start of with a player that could actually score, defend and rebound a bit, which was a way around the transaction system I guess. Even though this means hours and hours of playing. This year, the My GM version has been completely changed. There's no more VC to be earned ( or maybe very little when simulating the game ) , so the whole idea of playing My GM is just about the leaderboard. Now I play only single player games, I really don't care much about what the rest of the world is doing, the final result is that I get a global score apparently and this is supposed to make me feel satisfied with the hefty A+ rating game fee. In My GM mode, I have clicked the A button probably more then 1000 times. The gameplay is all about ""chit chats"" with players and staff. I wouldn't use Action points in the first days of the week (or limited at least) and then would chit chat with a player sometimes 3 times in a row to get the trust up. That is just weird, I love basketball, but I'm pretty sure that any player wouldn't enjoy going to a restaurant with me 3 times in a day. So I would say the My GM has been a major disappointment this year.The My Player however, I am pretty satisfied with. It's an improvement in gameplay compared to previous years. I have only played C position so far, and I can hit A+ rather quickly in the mycareer and the VC earning goes much quicker as well. I got this game on the black Friday sale after skipping the release because of the once again negative comments. I feel that it's worth the purchase now, if not only the My GM is a complete waste of time, energy , and general happiness of the right thumb."

1089350,1,0,akiratoya13,52,3,1,236.1,"12 December, 2019","In simple word: THIS IS THE BEST NBA GAMES EVER.I know many people won't agree. But, here's my point:1. I'm NOT PLAYING ONLINE. I enjoy every mechanism of the game. It's so much realistic in offense and defense compared to 2K19. Love the flexibility on new dribble mechanism even though it's much harder for me...2. The AI much more natural when reacted to our move, more human like. Even 1 on 1 battle feels so much fun in 2K20.Note: I'm not trying online not because there's so much cheater, or there's so much grinding. But, it's pointless for me. If I want to play my own player, I will just create a player, then play with it. AND the TOP reason that I'm not playing online is: I'm from Indonesia. I use very fast internet connection, and good ping. But still, the server of NBA lagging for my country ( I think ).SO, IS THE GAME WORTH THE PRICE?Sorry for most of people that disappointed in this game, but I think it is really worth the price. Just think about the gameplay alone, it's worth it. :)It's not that I'm not agreeing with all of you that's not satisfied with 2K response to the community, but at least I know the price is right, even though they still need to improve their response and service.That's all :D."

There are a lot of glitches that you just have to live with and the game takes a long time to download. The keyboard controls are not good but if you have a controller it is so much better. In some ways I like 2k18 more but in most way I like this. I give this game a 6/10 for one reason. I would rate it higher but whenever there is 2kTV there is just a big green screen. This really bugged me but I just gave up. The game is ok and if you have a controller than you should go for it. The best time to buy is when its on sale.

You need only 60hz with VSync on. This is such a let down. With 60hz, the game is so much smoother to play on consoles (PS4 Pro, Xbox One X).

1089350,0,0,ppizzaislife,106,2,1,262.9,"7 December, 2019","I don't care about the microtransactions anymore, I mean if people are stupid enough to spend real-life hard earned money on overpriced in-game currency worth nothing(it's not like I haven't spent atleast 100+Â£ on VC in past 3 years) why would they change it when it makes probably twice the money as the game alone? It's not their fault, it's our fault.Let me get to the gameplay, I LOVE IT! Besides AI being stupid, such as randon switches or switches on pick n rolls or standing in the paint when there is a guy open it the corner on fastbreak or AI unable to turn around while opponent is sprinting on fastbreak, gameplay is pretty damn good. I only played MyCarrer, finally after all the years you can use menu to navigate the game not the pointless and time wasting walking in the neighborhood. Feel like game is pretty smooth very enjoyable for me, love the new creation of the player, people say it is the same as archtypes but its not, you can leave out pointless abilities you dont need(e.g. my PF doesnt need ballhandling or steals) and you can max out other atributes, you still cannot create a Lebron, Giannis or Luka but you can get closer to your dream build this year.I don't expect anything from the servers as PC has the lowest playerbase compared to consoles(atleast I think, some1 fact check that) so makes sense they dont't give much attention to the PC servers. I played one park game and it seemed alright much better than 2K19 experience but hard to judge from one game.All in all I feel I haven't enjoyed a 2K game this much since 2K17, hope it stays this way. IF YOU LIKE GAME OF BASKETBALL - MUST HAVE TITLE.NEVER. STOP. BALLIN.EDIT: after few more hours and leveling up myplayer I must say the game is good. Not perfect but good enough for me, after last few years of playing this game on PC and servers crashing all the time and park games disconecting, its much better. There is still input lag so if you expect perfect game its not for you. Also the problems I had with AI was just me not realizing I didn't change the difficulty from Pro to HOF, the switching and defending was not that bad after the change but I was wondering how im droping 50-20-10 on HOF with my 80ovr player."

The controls aren't intuitive and they tried to add so much complexity to it that I found it detracted from the overall gameplay. Also, to some extent, you have to make the game realistic and take the player out of the game, but if I'm testing my build, I should stay in the entire game. Testing the build is just about trying things, and it doesn't help to be simulating half the game and not playing in it. I also think the practice drills could seriously be improved on. I should be learning things I can actually use in real games, and not random skills that aren't really applicable. Overall, 2/5 stars. Sad I spent $30 on this game probably never to play it again."

These developers and money hoarders are unapologetic for making such a pathetic and money sucking game. You can spend hours in the game grabbing badges and leveling up, but when it comes to playing competitive gameplay the only thing that will guarantee you a victory is your spot in the unemployment line, or you losing your life savings to a game that Ctrl + C -> Ctrl + P their game every year. The amount of times your character will miss a open shot full white with a 95 - 3pt shooting rating will have you buying multiple controllers as you will break them all. The only good things in this game are the myleague and myteam modes, assuming you have friends to play with. The graphics are amazing but don't make up for the hollow and disfigured core of a game. You can't spray paint a turd gold and tell me I'm rich."

On the bright side it is a bit more realistic, but the movements seem choppier than last years. Also there are certain bugs that annoy me like the jumpshots dont save right and a lot of park animations never work. Although the badge system is wonderful and makes up for a lot of the cons.

I don't why it hasn't been fixed yet.About every 10 games in MyCareer, the game records all the VC you earn, but don't give them to you. I had  fewer than 100 VC before my most recent MyCareer game, supposedly earned about 1000 VC in MyCareer and went to the progression tab, I hadn't received any VC. I've only played about 30 games on PC, but this also happened to me on PS4.All the Gatorade gym training mini-games are horrible. Absolutely awful and poorly implemented. I don't like the neighborhood feature in general, but the rest of it is at least tolerable. I do like the new story. I think it's good that they highlight how student athletes are exploited by colleges. I also really like the player creator now, because you can make a really specialized player with a unique set of skills.Almost all the improvements seem geared toward MyTeam and MyCareer. I don't particularly like MyTeam because it's like a free to play Mobile game stapled onto a trading card game and the only purpose is to drain your wallet. Game modes like MyLeague sees little improvement, which is a shame because I really like MyLeague.In addition to this, there are a lot of loading screens and a number of bugs. The game crashed on my a couple of times and during the draft combine, I was spawned into a gym with free movement and other NPCs were standing in position waiting for the cut scene(that didn't trigger) to start. This also happened during a NBA game. This is also the first time the MyCareer mode is forced online.In the last few years NBA 2K has become gradually more focused on MyTeam and the online components of MyCareer (Pro-Am). This isn't something I necessarily have a problem with, but it comes at the detriment of the older features like MyLeague and the some components of MyCareer. I think this product has become gradually more anti-consumer and cynical. The gambling aspect of MyTeam alone is odious, it's basically just loot crates again."

The people giving this game bad reviews are the same ones giving this game bad reviews since 2014, people who can't play the game, and complain about microtransactions that you actually don't need since the game gives you plenty of oportunity to earn VC just by playing. 2. while the online has hiccups most of the bad reviews are salty Btches who jack up shots online with KOBEEEEE and can't win a game because they don't know the fundamentals of team basketball. 3. this game has the most fluid and best basketball game play around but it my be too real for those little kids ( the ones putting the bad reviews )  since it's not NBA JAM or some un realistic game like that. 4. This game is full of stuff to do , My career, My Team, GM ect if you look closely at the people who complain like little Btchs you'll see some of them have 100 to 600 hours of game play..... think about that for a minute most games dont even give you 20 to 30 and this one gives you 100+ and people complain, MILLENIALS gotto love em.

This year, It takes roughly 1 full season and a handful of game to get to 99.With 170 hours logged in, as of writing this review; I've reached level 99 with my first created character (1 championship season and 6 games),   and currently 93 with my second character after only 54 games."

1089350,0,0,fakundak,78,1,-1,51.7,"8 September, 2020","Maybe the worst NBA2K game ever. NBA2K games getting worse since 2015. There are skipless animations and visuals, make you stare your screen for nearly 20-30 sec for every foul, timeout, end of period, end of quarter, opening and ending. I just want to play the game. Why do i care rebound leader when im a point guard? Why should i look at James Harden's dropping assist numbers in every Rocket's matchup? I dont care about NBA2K21's demo. Im not interested in Dorris Burke and her speech. I just want to skip them. Ah i forgot the honorable mention, referee. When you get fouled and go to freethrow line for the first time, referee just tells some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to players for 10 seconds. In total when you play 6 minutes long quarters, you wait about 6-7 minutes to play 18 minutes of real time. The AI works at least ""proper enough"" on older games. But in this game, even the simplest screen call breaks the game which causes defender to leave a gap for dodgin screen. That leaves you nearly wide-open or maximum of %10 contested statwise. Instead you dodge defender by just waiting and pressing left bumper and calling screen. Then rain 3s. Even AI abuse this. I see often that Curry call screen, wait for 3 seconds without moving and just take 3s. If you call a simplest gameplan, opposing team struggle to adapt it, causes easy points. Gameplay is really horrible in MyCarrer single player mode. There are issues with body colliders. You can use all your stamina to bump some1s leg and cant move an inch.Difficulty settings are not boosting opposing teams AI but boost their stats, also lower your teams IQ to 0. The most irritating part is in HOF when i miss only 1 shot, my character going cold. Cant hit shots from close range, wide open with 85 close shot rating when i get full white bars. Also some animations are better than others (offers better frame windows for making perfect timing for scoring) but it is hidden so you need to constantly search for dataminer pages to get good one, cuz devs constantly patch them.There are missing shot types and animations when i compare to older versions. There is a dropstep layup and dunk in game (i guess. there is a badge about it lol.) even i tried 2 hours to get a dropstep layup. i cant seem to find. also there is no knowledge about how to dropstep in controls menu. Only you can do is floater and eurostep. Dropstep and runnershots are missing. Fadeaway shots only available in post. There are no fancy dribbling moves. A lot of dunk styles are missing.i did not play myteam. i dont have word for that.There is a grind part in this game but i wont b*tch about it, it seems very easy when you can abuse AI.Multiplayer part is laggy af.Commentary is very limited opposed to older versions.Curry special: Can make 3s from halfcourt.0/10 i wont play again and not recommendAlso sorry for bed Englando xD"

Overall NBA 2k20 is kinda sleazy with the micro-transactions. But, when it comes to overall presentation and simulation... WOW this game is tops. Say I try to make a tight pass to a guy cutting to the basket... If my player realistically could pull that off the play looks gorgeous! Far better than previous years... the play looks like two players in sync executing the way professionals do. When I make bonehead plays and turn the ball over... it looks like a player had a lapse in judgement... maybe even tries to take it back but cannot... IT IS GORGEOUS!!!The Story in the My Player mode is actually pretty good as well. I used to be solely a Franchise Mode guy, but this year's story mode is fairly good. I doubt I'll continue it long, but the initial story is good. The micro-transactions really nerf how good your player can be unfortunately. You can have a solid experience, but there is a limit to how good you can get compared to the other pros without investing $$$. Franchise mode is so amazingly good this year. I watch teams make intelligent trade proposals! At least mostly... better than previous years. The coaching options like Defensive Match-ups and Strategy screens are simultaneously deeper and easier to understand at the same time! How is that even possible!The play by play is also outstanding. I get near, actual interviews that are somehow contextual to the actions in the game (again for the most part). I hear J.R. Smith get interviewed and talk about how we were driving the ball to the hole so well... and that's actually true... it's an actual interview that is contextually relevant to the goings on of my particular execution of a simulation... that's just uncanny awesome.I know at this point I sound like a fanboy... Well I am. This is a great game. The people in charge of the presentation deserve major praise for this achievement. Seriously, everyone responsible for every part of the presentation of this game deserves MAJOR PRAISE!!"

The MC mode is too hard, it takes way too long to get the VC to upgrade your player if you don't purchase VC in game.  You don't have enough VC to upgrade your player, your player is like trash, no agility, hard to make shot, can't keep up with AI's speed, even you have a chance for free throw, it's hard to make it, because your free threw is under 50 when you are just started the season. For fully upgrade your player you will need around 20k VC, not including all the animations, clothes shoes, or stuff like that.At your first season, you would probably get 750VC as your salary plus your performance, so you will get around 800-900 VC every game. Even you can get extra VC from other contracts and team practice, I would say you will need at least 2 seasons for fully upgrade your player. Plus you need to farm for the badges, the badges is based on your performance on court such as making shots, assists and rebounds etc. But if you don't have high abilities it's gonna be hard for you, therefore kind of force you to buy VC."

I would recommend anyone who enjoys offline sport games to give NBA a try when it's on sale, I'm not big on playing the game online and I rarely have however the offline content in MyCareer (havent played it this year but I assume it's similar to last year which I enjoyed), MyTeam (Spotlight series, updated triple threat with more rewards, domination) and MyLeague (Always fun trying to make your favourite team the best) continue to provide endless avenues of fun for the player whilst challenging them just the right amount.I don't play online and I always hear a lot of backlash for their servers. I don't play MyTeam unlimited or triple threat online (only have played a half dozen games of Triple Threat Online) but I would recommend sourcing more reviews for information on their online play.Overall, would recommend NBA2k20 if you enjoy playing offline and against the AI in MyTeam, if you want to play online, consult other reviews which discuss the 2K servers."

Some are on PC and some are on console.I focused on MC mode only.Conclusion: The MC mode these years made me cancer.Reason:1. Years and years, MC mode story kept telling you about a young man chasing dream. But ironically the game mechanism tells you a different story.                                   YOU CANT BECOME AS GREAT AS THOSE LEGENDS DOESYou wanna be a great 3pts shooter like curry does?  OK.You wanna be a great ball handler like curry at the same time?  Maybe.You wanna be a great slasher like curry at the same time?  Nope, only average level, cause your life is limited.What about defense? Nope, you are gonna be â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on defense that everyone can one step dribble through you easily.                                       YOU JUST CANT BE AS GREAT AS THOSE LEGENDS DOESReally frustrating.2. Stupid teammate AI and God like opponents AIOld problems on MC are still there, and never seems to be fixed, or it's their purpose to do so.How stupid the teammate AI is? Try call a pick, slash in, drag the defense under basket, and pass to the open C or PF teammate. Guess what? they will either hold the ball rather than shoot it immediately and wait for the defense covers him again and than shoot, or skip the offense chance and run a random play on the playbook.WHY? HOW? Mystery.3. The unreal RPG experiment RPG is a good mechanism, but not with a bad implementation.In the story you'll be a 1st round about top ten picks player if you try hard.But a weird thing happened. An overall rating 65 player in a lottery pick?Dude, this guy can't even sink an open mid range!Even my grandma can do it.The only thing this guy can do as well as my grandma is the moving speed.This dude, this lottery pick dude moves like he's carrying a 100KG bag on his back.When ever he needs to do a sharp turn, it takes him 1.5 second.He's in the fxcking NBA. And he needs 1.5 second to do a sharp turn. OMFGWhen it comes to the situation that you've been double team, its ugly.This dude cant even pass a ball anymore. This pathetic dude has played through the NCAA for four years, and when it comes to deal with the double team, he cant even pass the ball properly.-------------------------------------------------------------------I'm not finished, but I'm tired and got to sleep.Hope I wont be dreaming bout these crap."

Each year it gets worse and worse. If you enjoy feeling like you want to rip your hair out, play this game - it's for you. If you enjoy basketball simulation, don't buy this game. Don't play this game. Stay far away from this game. I have put 330+ hours into NBA 2k20 and I refuse to load up and play the game anymore. I will no longer buy NBA 2k products. They have lost me as a customer forever because of 2k20. They sell you a broken game each year,  claiming it's better than last year but it's always broken. 2k20 was the final straw for me. They don't know how to fix it so you will never see a fix for all the bugs. False advertising everywhere in this game. STAY FAR AWAY from this game."

The bugs in this game are ridiculous, the game will crash to the desktop frequently making you lose your progress. Updating graphics drivers, restarting PC, etc does not fix it.

If a player gets injured, they won't resign with the team because they're not happy with their time on the court. That can happen while they have 2 years on their contract and no amount of starting time will change their mind. Generally players just aren't happy with anything. If you have a player with a 74-75 rating, they'll be upset not to be a starter playing behind the best player in the league. It's super clear to me, that they have invested in trying to get the player to use money in the game and anything that's not driven by micro transactions is pretty much a non-priority. Gameplay is probably still the best NBA experience available, so it's too bad they stopped caring about people who just want to buy a game and play it...."

This, in my opinion, is a good game core ruined by excessive microtransactions. Yet, at it's core, 2k20 is not a bad game. Unlike 18, which had no defense at all and blowby's were incredibly easy, or 19 where a guy like JJ Reddick could play lockdown D on LeBron, 2k20 actually has  a good balance of defense and offence. The new badge system is great; it allows for more customization and an overall more unique gamestyle to each player. Post play has been nerfed. Centers being able to be rim protectors and outside shooters is rare. There are still issues with myTeam and myCareer, though. The myCarer story is not good. Somehow even worse than 19, imo. Both are stil microtransaction hell, and it is the samer prk as last year. But, by itself, the core gameplay is good.I primarily play myLeague, which hasn't really changed. MyGM, on the other hand, is completely different. There is no more just cringe inducing dialogue; you have to deal with sponsorships, meet with players, hold a weekly press conference, and manage all aspects of team business and running operations. That being said, the new action points system kinda sucks. You shouldn't need them to play a game. Plus, quarter length is locked at 6 minutes and I believe difficulty is locked at pro. Although myGM is completely â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, I think that the gameplay this year is much better."

1089350,2,1,juslove,225,3,1,379.7,"31 October, 2019","The engine has improved from last year. For those who enjoy realism modeled on the court, this is the best 2k yet. VC rewards for playing MyCareer (actual NBA games - not park) has improved but the VC facet of the game in general is still trash.The game is overall better and MyLeague has increased the available tweaks and controls over the league. Park play is better (less laggy so far), but it's not my preferred method as significant input lag is unplayable to me. It's not a light year leap, but for a less than 1 year dev effort and version update, it's as good as any other years' progress. Also, WNBA ftw!My biggest gripe (paid VC aside) is that what my player can be (skill-wise) e.g. a one of a kind player such as Lebron, Steph, MJ, Giannis is limited because the same character that you use solo is forced to be your multiplayer character. Let park attributes and career attributes be managed separately for balance even through the same character. In real life, there are players who are sharpshooters and elite finishers at the rim. I don't want to be blocked from that in my solo career progression because of park (where the caps actually make sense).Overall, the core game play is better than ever and the solo MyCareer experience (and fortunately more generic story) is better than any previous year. VC is still VC and park servers are still laggy, granted slightly less. The graphical improvement is more visible this year than any previous and I basically have a NASA computer so I wont bother to comment on PC performance."

I only wanted to do one thing, play MyCareer. That right now at the time of this review is impossible to play due to a glitch in the game that doesn't allow me to play a game without crashing. I really liked 2k19 and I wanted 2k20 to be good, but sadly this will be the last 2k I'll ever buy. I just submitted a refund ticket and hopefully Steam will grant it because I literally can't play the game anymore. The 7hrs I had on record was me playing through the beginning of MyCareer mode. As soon as I got drafted into the Lakers, the first game against the Clippers showed the game breaking bug.EDIT: I've figured out how to bypass the Sub In Bug and I can now actually play MyCareer. I'm enjoying the game but not as much as 2k19. I'm still going to be grinding in this game for the remainder of the year because this game isn't that bad for what I solely wanted to do."

Then when all seems good and merry I lose connection mid game and get an L. Park is just dominated by pay to win sweats bc this is pc.

Why is my 7"" center switching on defense with the point guard 5 feet behind the 3 point line? Get sent to the bench after building an early 10 point lead, then come back in just minutes later down 15... Miss wide open shots that are timed right, but fling a mistimed shot and it randomly goes in? How many full court buzzer beating heaves go in nothing but net IRL? Why is the coach putting me (a starter) in the game with 20 seconds left in the 4th quarter when we're up by 20 points? So many things make absolutely no sense - and they're not new to 2K20 at all.

1089350,0,0,SimuLord,162,36,-1,17.1,"6 September, 2020","The last game in this series that I bought was 2K12. I put over 1,000 hours into it; it is still to this day the third most-played game all-time on my Steam account behind Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 4.I'd avoided the series since then because they ruined MyCareer with the gross nickel-and-diming microtransactions, and the mode itself, if you didn't want to pay-to-win, would take 100 hours or more just to get to ""mediocre, legit rotation bench player on a franchise-mode team"" level of player.But 2K12 started to feel like a relic after awhile; that was Kobe Bryant's NBA and Dirk Nowitzki's NBA, not Giannis Antetokounmpo's NBA; 2K20 cover athlete Anthony Davis played his one and only college season in 2011-12 and isn't in the old game.For five bucks, I bought 2K20...and my gods, what an absolute atrocity, a disappointment at any price, a just plain terrible game.Leave aside the gross pay-to-win multiplayer that combines a full-price retail product (or even one you get for 92% off) with one of the most exploitative microtransaction models in all of AAA gaming. You don't need me to tell you how awful that is.What really jumps out at me is how genuinely terrible the actual basketball is, even in single-player MyLeague mode where you're not asked to participate in the MyCareer grind or to even look at the VC store.The AI is straight out of 2K12, but the players' skillset is built for a modern league. The ""pace and space"" offense? Get real. Players with open looks from 3 will dribble into traffic and pull up for a contested midrange jump shot. The switching on defense is so bad that the player will frequently be forced onto a terrible matchup (player-lock yourself to the point guard and see how often you're switched onto the center every time there's a high screen and then bullied at the rim by a much bigger player. Take off the player lock and you can partially fix this but the AI will then just lose track of the guard for an open shot instead.)Move the sliders to try and force the AI to favor the 3-point shot? Sure, they won't drive into traffic anymore, but then you're exposed to a different problem, namely that nobody short of Dame Lillard can make an open 3, and you'll add in a problem where players with a defender right in their face will shoot a contested shot with no chance of going in.I have over a thousand hours in 2K12. The AI in 2K20 hasn't changed in eight years as the league has evolved underneath it. So it's not like I don't know how to play video game basketball.And one other thing worth mentioning? Too often, I'd be guarding the opposing point guard, me just below the arc, the opponent out 30 feet from the basket.In today's game, if you do that, point guards can drain a 3 from out there and make a defender pay for leaving them wide-open. It's changed the entire way that NBA defense is played and opened up floor spacing in a way that's wildly entertaining.In NBA 2K20? The point guard will dribble down to 8 seconds on the shot clock, initiate an isolation, and then make one pass or try to drive the lane so predictably that you can take away the lane and force a 16-foot floater that goes in far more often than it ever has in real life...including during the early aughts, when NBA 2K was on the PlayStation 2 and that kind of offense was still common in pro basketball.Terrible AI, a complete failure on the developers to understand how to simulate the game in 2020, and disgusting pay-to-win multiplayer and even singleplayer modes.All of this adds up to 98 GB of hard drive space I'm going to use for something else, because this game's getting uninstalled for good after just 17 hours, unthinkable for a sports title.Don't buy this game at any price. Don't buy any game in this series at any price until 2K fixes this, because right now they're clearly making too much money to care."

But the multiplayer is a disaster, worst i ever see.POSITIV:- Fantastik story mode but no variations after playing a while.- Good my career mode to play alone (best part of the game)- GFX is good. HD and 4K solution settings are possible. NEGATIV:- moderate basketball move animation and not very smooth animation in motion transitions.- very CPU intensive stress to system because of bugs and a lot of game crshes.- too much bugs, spezially keybindings, and network. Grafik-bugs, screen-bugs, lot of multiplayer lagging and skipping animation etc.- keybinding are switching between default settings and own settings from time to time.Mutiplayer not playable here some examples of a lot others:- not able to chat or communicate with other players in neighborhood- VOIP doesnt work properly and cause to game crash often - if VOIP works u got probÃ¶lems in understanding players because of annoying ambiente sound like helicopter.- forming groups squads cause to game crash very often.- very often heavy network laggings.- not able to find matchups in time- cost to much time finding players of same level to play with.- no balancing in finding equal players - no long time motivation to play.- unablle skiping Intros/Animation/tvshows and at least after waiten 5 sec to be able to skip it. Annoying and time-consuming waiting espacially in second season after knowing all events/animation/tv-shows- some bad and wrong implementation of BB Game rules, on fouls and time violations.And if you know the basketball rules you will fast reconize that a lot of rules are implemented wrong. For example their is no shot clock violation if the ball leaves the shooters hand before times end and of course shot counts. But it does not in this game!!!!After over 300 hrs playing i have to say ""what a bad game at all"". it makes me angry!I woulnt buy this game again if i had a choice now. I buyed this game to play multiplayer with friends online on free court and all my friends quit playing this game. At the begin we are 11 players - now no one is playing anymore.

The only limitation is that it has to play well and look good on this current generation of consoles as most of its sales are on generated from console sales. Seems to me like everyone negatively reviewing this game is just hating on the VC , the over the top online park, and the microtransactions, but just for actually simulating playing the actual game of basketball, it is topnotch! Just look at most if not all of the negative reviews and most all of them speak negatively about the aspects of the game that donâ€™t even pertain to actual basketball gameplay! As a NBA 2K console player for many years now, I am enjoying playing NBA 2K basketball (now with the WNBA) on my laptop and while it can always be improved upon, it is by no means a bad or terrible game. It actually plays quite well considering the recent patches. Seems to me like a lot of people are just jumping on the negative bandwagon because it cost real money to make a fictional player in their likeness play well in the create a player online portion of the game. Personally, I believe not every  personalized created player online should be ranked a 95 or higher overall player right out the gate anyways... (That would be some really unrealistic and crazy gameplay). Anyways, if you play this game to simulate the actual game of basketball and the NBA League it does that job quite well! Note: if you play this game on a NVIDIA equipped laptop be sure to dedicate your graphics card to your laptop as the game for some reason will try and use the internal integrated graphics card as a primary graphics card? To do this, right click on the desktop and select NVIDIA Control Panel. Once in the control panel select manage 3D settings and under Global Settings select High Performance NVIDIA Processor, apply and then you will be good to go. Learned this the hard way at first as the game played really slowly on my laptop until I figured this out. Now it plays smoother and better than my console."

However, if you're expecting an improved experience over 2K19, you will unfortunately be disappointed. The comments about this being a copy/paste of 2K19 are accurate, this game feels identical to the previous installment, save for some minor interface updates. Even with the new Rookies, they haven't included actual photos of them, they're just computer generated faces, so if you're buying this game to get the most recent up to date teams, you may as well just stick with 2K19 and download a rookie/roster update pack, because that is all this game really is, a $60 roster update. It comes across as very lazy.For that, I've given this game a negative rating. I'm also pretty turned off by the whole casino/gambling thing, but as mentioned, I only play MyLeague, so I thankfully don't have to experience those things.If you do plan on buying this game, wait until it is on special, because it really isn't worth the price tag at the moment."

What a time to be alive.Edit: I have played over 1,000 more hours of 2k and because of this Steam wants me to revise my review. The shooting I have grown accustom to, in this 2k you will miss many more shots than the previous 20 entries, this can be extremely frustrating. MyCareer is the best it's been in this game, unfortunely, by month 3 the park was overrun by hackers, sitting at 95 overall and with slenderman arms. This is achieved using ""Cheat Engine"", a program I personally haven't used since 2010 when I was hacking Wizard101. Explain to me why this same exploit works in NBA 2K20, a less than a year old triple A title. MyTeam is by far the best gamemode this year, cards like GOAT Kobe, Steph Curry, and Larry Bird add a lot of time-killing grinding, and are likely why I have 1k hours on this game. These cards are outclassed, naturally, by the GOAT cards in packs that you can pay real money for for a chance at them. Packs this year are more expensive than they have ever been, and the odds seem worse than previous entries. MyLeague/GM is a joke, it has been the exact same game mode for 4 years in a row. I genuinely don't think 2k cares about this mode, being that fundamentally, year to year, nothing changes."

I was highly hesitant to buy the game because of how negative the outrage over it is.  End up breaking down and buying because how hyped I am for the upcoming season.  I immediately go into the one mode I stay out of normally which if myteam.  Start playing and after awhile forgot about what I was suppose to be doing, which was finding all this bad micro-transactions.  I was never even tempted to buy VC.  I think the game outright asked me once if I wanted to buy some and then that was it.  After that its just advertisements for the stores and whatnot.  IF you care about competetion during the first few months for esports or whatnot I could see you having an issue.  Past that its just a slightly above average basketball game.  Also, happens to be the only basketball game out right now, so if you wanted to just enjoy a basketball game/simulator then NBA 2K20 is perfectly enjoyable for the price point.Negative points about the game:  1) the timeout loadtimes - feel like you could work out a way to really decrease loadtimes during timeout.  Rest of loadtimes feel normal.  2) the story mode is pretty weak.  I mean yea its cool to change the world but I kind of don't need my slasher to do that.

The game has had multiple large patches that have completely changed the way it is played, and made certain player builds that were good at launch completely useless. Additionally the servers seem to be somehow even worse than last year despite claims that 2K20 had new servers to eliminate the issues from last year.The game is full of ads for companies that paid to be included in the game not to mention the ads for VC (the in game virtual currency) all over. To make matters worse VC is the only way to increase the abilities of your custom player and any cosmetic item you may want to apply (ie shoes, jerseys, braces, sleeves, etc) can only be acquired by purchasing with VC. Even more offensive is the fact that the equivalent USD amount for many of these items ranges from 10-35 REAL WORLD DOLLARS.

I've played 31 hours and i'm already 82 overall without any microtransactions and loving every minute of it. I've got 2K15 through 2K19 on steam and those were ok for the most part, however I have always played on Hall of Fame 12 minute quarters. In those games it felt like my team was absolutely useless, I couldn't hit shots and just became a volume shooter and the movement slow and clunky. Also when they had changed the free throw to a badge and just how you got badges in the previous games was an absolute grind to Hall of Fame badges (or just badges in general were a grind).However with 2K20 the new skill system is amazing, not hard to ""grind"" them at all because you get a lot of points to unlocking a level in the skills from just playing, in combination with the extra practice sessions its no issue and a huge plus. The movement and speeds of all the characters feels a million times better, you can do stop and go moves, use your quick speeds and you don't have C's catching you down the floor on the break anymore. Loving the story as well, really interesting take on your way to the NBA, with a bonus of great actors to be apart of it. As for the difficulty level, as I said I play Hall of Fame 12 minute quarters and this is the only 2K (2K15, 2K16, 2K17, 2K18, 2K19) that I can actually play Hall of Fame properly without getting utterly frustrated from it seeming like nothing can go right. I feel like its got horrible reviews because people look to purchasing microtransactions to be amazing straight out of college, which isn't realistic, and then complain about how aggressive the microtransactions can be. And yes, obviously its pretty microtransaction themed in a way, but at no point have I thought about buying microtransactions in this 2K. In previous I had because I got so frustrated that I couldn't do anything right ingame, so to solve that I had bought them.

Sad but true and the funny thing is, they protect the hackers like no tomorrow. Overall I would say do not invest money into NBA 2K or any of their PC games, even investing it into console enables them to keep printing the same game each year with zero anti-cheat and the worst support possible, the real only way to make a change is to do what? Protest their horrible services and treatment of customers.

There has been so many game changing patches since the game came out, you really wonder if you're playing a demo or beta. Examples:For some reason now there is a better chance of shooting an early shot and it going in, then shooting a slightly early just off the green window. No matter what 2K promises the servers will never be good. Because if 2K can manage to save any money for in game performance, you'll be safe to bet a million dollars that they will surrender customer experience for MONEY.Shot contest is a joke. You can contest a shot / layup and be given 'good shot contest' only for the shot to go in. Don't buy the game now. Wait until next year. The game will be much more polished ( hopefully ) and you will have a much better experience compared to buying it right now. In totality 2K is so out of touch with their community and game. Simple bugs and glitches aren't even noticed by the dev team, but are noticed within the first 20 minutes of launch by the community. They released an un-finished product per usual."

So you you cannot really become a great NBA player. Example: You`re great at post offence, but that means you can only be mediocre in Rebounds, Defense, Driving, Passing, etc. It makes no sense. You can't aspire to be a player like Jokic, Durant, Lebron, who a great at more than one aspect of the game. This was a porlbem last year and they doubled down on it this year. You're supposed to create more than one player, I guess (thus more opportunity for microtransactions). And another thing that has plagued the series for a while now: Unskippable animations/cut-scenes before the game, during time-outs, etc. I feel like every 2 minutes someone is taking the controller away from me, saying: You gotta watch this 10 second Gatorade commercial before you can continue playing.

I almost had it where I could thread enough needles to have fun with this game, but every time I get there, something happens to break it.  It shouldn't be this hard to enjoy a video game.Update:  The game can work with a CPU vs. CPU my league but it has to be done differently.  You have to control every team, but change every team except the one you want to control to auto everything in the management area.  This will enable you to view games other teams play.  It's not ideal, but it is a workaround that works easily enough.  Original Review: Broken for CPU vs. CPU sim playersTried to play other games in a myleague and let the CPU vs CPU go and while the option appears to be available as you can check the games, and the option has indeed been there for at least a decade, it appears to not work this year.  While I know we are a small portion of the people who play the game, it's impressive that they actually decided either to purposely remove that feature or be so buggy a game that they accidentally removed it.  Maybe this game will be worth it after they fix, but for CPU vs CPU players in my league, this game is currently a non starter."

Builder also gives you a hint who's similar to your player. That makes you capable of creating player similar to any real player you like.-capability of choosing badges you need/like etc...

I've currently played both MyCareer and MyTeam, and I like the flexibility the game gives you when you make your player. Not a perfect game, but still a pretty good one."

The single-player gameplay is fantastic, though. Easily the best basketball simulation so far, one of the best sports simulations as well. The game feels less hyper and unrealistically quick as previous games, all in the name of realism. Graphics seem slightly better than 2K19, and the animations are much better. You can customize all of the animations from previous 2ks, as well as new things, such as dribble/running style. A lot of subtle jumpshot and dribble animations were added, making the game feel much more realistic. I enjoy the new MyCareer system, except for the awfully long grind. In-game, it's pretty enjoyable as a campaign experience. As a person who likes the single-player, simulation aspect of 2K, and occasionally creating custom characters to insert into the NBA, this is easily the best 2k yet.The online is less than worthless. Only people playing it are blatant cheaters, 99 ovr everything, morbidly obese kids who can't get out of their mobility scooter in real life so they have to pretend to be good at a basketball video game instead. Buy a PS4 if you want a decent online experience."

I'm not at all surprised about the micro-transactions, lets be real, this is 2k they're not going to slow down on that. I do understand that it's tough to make an annual sports title that actually has new content and I'm happy to say that 2k, for the most part, has actually done some great work with some of the new features. However, MOST of these are implemented in the wrong way, and/or broken. The progression system is really good, it allows you to actually choose which attributes you want to upgrade. That was one of my biggest issues with 2k19 and before. Instead of hoping to get your next ball handling/3 pt attribute upgrade, you're allowed to upgrade any of them to your cap right off the bat, that's really great. Here come the issues...The shooting, it is soooo inconsistent. I have made shooting builds and miss open 3s and 2s CONSISTENTLY. So basically the only way to make shots is to get a green release, which for most of the people playing this game casually, myself included, its not fun to shoot because you have to concentrate so hard to make your shots. And this is offline too... Not even in the park. This means that it doesn't really matter how you build your character unless you know your jumpshot or have badges, which kind of removes the point of attributes in the first place. Next is badges. You basically are a 10 OVR if you have no badges. If you have an 80 3pt and no badges, you shouldn't even attempt a 3 because you're most likely gonna miss. ON PRO!!! On top of that it takes for ever to get a badge upgrade point. I'm a 90 OVR with 5 playmaking badges and it takes me 6-8 games on 12 minute quarters to get 1 badge, which is basically upgrading 1 badge to bronze, unless you have more, then you can respec, make some HOF, gold, silver, etc. It really sucks this way because, why should I even upgrade my 3pt in the first place if I can't shoot without HOF range extender, deadeye, steady shooter, difficult shots, quickdraw. I just don't know what they were thinking.This game ultimately isn't rewarding, getting yourself open for looks only to miss on a full white isn't my idea of fun, it's more frustrating than I ever thought it would be. In the end, I cannot recommend the 2k series from this point on unless they address these issues. Hopefully micro-transactions go away in a couple more 2k's and maybe soon we'll actually be able to make an NBA superstar, but until then, save your money, it's really not worth 80$."

I buy the game almost every year it comes out, having said that here is a quick review of how Quick Play Online, one of my favorite modes:Quick Play Online: pretty much broke- most of the games encounter a problem that doesn't allow it to finish (and not counted on your record). I have a very good Internet connection and network seems fine, but netcode or whatever on NBA2k side seems terrible. After all these years, errors like these still have not been fixed. It's not a new error on PC and game play issues surrounding online vs. have been there for years. - still after all these years, no microphone supported game chat against opponents on PC- why am i still buying this game? because i love basketball and this game, but... it's getting a bit silly.- i remember when 2k was light years ahead of nba live. Nowadays, I wish nba live would come back to PC, so 2k would actually have to fix their broken game. Or anything? Maybe CD Project Red can make a basketball game.- i'm happy to review other aspects of the game, but by far quick play online is my favorite (and almost unplayable)."

My career story line is un-creative & over dramatized, ultimately it ISN'T the players choice. Game is monetized to the millionth degree. Unless you buy Virtual Currency in the game you get destroyed. Game is built to bleed real life money from online players instead of offering a pleasurable experience to a single player campaign or story line.I left a bad review for 2k19 and no one listened, this game is exactly the same, why would I pay for the exact same game. Im so disappointed I don't ever want to play NBA 2k again and i'm a life long fan since 2000. Make a game that delivers enjoyment not monetization. THIS IS NOT A MOBILE APP STOP TRYING TO MAKE MONEY OFF PEOPLE AFTER A RETAIL PURCHASE.I've refunded my purchase of the legendary edition. Will not buy 2k20 until the 1-10 dollar sale day in a year. Thats all your over-hyped story line and roster update is worth anymore."

I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if they patched in a option to just straight up buy badges because the progression rate is a joke.

In my opinion the game is fun but the servers needs alot of attention and some badges as well.

1089350,785,90,7.65612E+16,189,7,-1,291.8,"9 September, 2019","So first off, I'm a fool for buying the game this year. No way around it. Now lets get to the game itself. From my 7-8 hours of gameplay, i still see the same issues that the last few editions had. Let's name a few. Disliked the archetype system? Well this year that's changed, into the exact same thing without the names. There's literally no difference, except instead of sharpshooter/slasher/defender/etc, you now have pie charts that does the exact same thing.Want a Melo clone? Well â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you, have a watered down version that either doesn't know how to finish at the rim, shoot 3's, post up or have a ball handling stat that will enable you to go by terrible defenders. Chose 2, and forget all about defence. Wanna make a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Terrence Ross? Well pick between Dunks, 3pt and finishing at the rim. You can't have all 3. Wanna double team? You'll get minus point for leaving your assignment. Doesn't matter if you get a steal and win the game because of it. You left a person open, so the game will fault you for it. Got less than 70 in block rating? Your character will jump AWAY from the ball. I've played and trained basketball for tiny people. Even the 8 year olds know to jump TOWARDS the ball. Dislike cutscenes? Well bohoo. This game will force you to watch them. Liked last years choices when it came to MyGM? well â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you, this year you only get the storied version that nobody liked in 2k19.I could go on and on and on and on and .... But seriously, we all knew this was gonna be the game. 1 step forward 1 step back. Of course if you expect any focus on online play and hackers, well you're as big an idiot as i was. I realise my next words are gonna sound clichÃ©, but I won't be buying 2k games for a few years.I shouldn't have bought it this year, but i somehow fell for their marketing tricks and decided to give them 1 last chance. And holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ do i regret doing so. This is a trash game made by a trash developer, produced by a trash production team. It's trash.1st Edit: So i've played a bit more, and i've encountered so many other issues, that i think i need to keep going with this. Bear in mind that these are all bugs that were in previous years editions too.If you pass and the ball even scratches a player on the opposite team, it's about 50-50 if it'll count as a turnover or not. Doesn't matter if they actually had control over the ball or not. I'm currently an 80 overall, despite not having a single attribute above 70, and alot of my attributes being below 50. So this year we're able to play as the most overrated NBA star to ever grace the earth. Thanks 2K, you sure know how to give people what they want. Demarcus Cousins. So his injury apparently affected his shooting mostly, since he's now in the mid 60's on open 3 pointers, and high 50's on open midrange shots. Of course we all know lower body injuries â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ with your hands. But in that case they must have changed his tendencies too right? Nope. Every time i pass to him, he takes the jumper and of course misses. He might honestly be the worst player in the game right now, considering his stats vs tendencies. Teammates don't run their lanes or roll towards the basket. The amount of times a teammate will move to my exact position instead of rolling to an open basket is like 99% of the time. I'm using a Dualshock 4 Controller, and despite it being fully supported on the PS4, it's still not fully supported on PC. The game tells me to pass by pressing ""A"" despite my controller not having any ""A's""."

First of all, force you to pay but not even pay to win, you have to gamble. You cannot even compete with computer if you dont pay in MC or MT mode. Try yourself as a 65 overall in MC NBA game and you will be like a fool. Try  yourself with sapphire or lower card to play against diamond or higher card team and you will see god. Difficulty is a joke, if you have galaxy opal cards, hall of fame is easy. Secondly, make the offline content worse and force you to play online mode so go back to rule No.1. Thirdly, trash-like servers all around the world. No matter you are in US/EU/Asia, you will face network error anytime and loss your game progress no matter what you did. Not to mention there is a super lag in the server response which make the online play unplayable. (So you have to pay the money but we dont make sure there is a good server, hahhh) Fourth, so many bugs in the game. Players like air can run into each other's body/face/ball in the game if you look replay which is ridiculous. Auction house in MT mode cannot work correctly. Eg, if you search for silver cards, you will find bronzes. Auction house even broke down in the final month of 2k19 which means they dont fix it for the whole year when you play! 3 vs 3 offline in MT mode is unavailable. (Did 2k really serious to launch an unfinished game?) The program icon for 2k20 is still 2k19! So 2k is telling you directly that we are selling 2k19 again and you need to know all the customers you guys are fool! Last but not least, in the online game mode, so many cheaters, they use super power they force you to lose connection and lose the game but 2k did nothing. They only care about how to push you to spend more money but not the game experience!Overall, 2k basketball series is DEAD already and I really hope a new series to be available on PC, eg LIVE from EA, welcome back. I would try any other basketball games if they are close. DO NOT let 2k have this super monopoly in PC platform any more! THEY DONT DESERVE!"

But as new versions of the game get introduced each year, we're treated with almost the same features with only some minor tweaks and changes. I wish 2K stops producing yearly NBA 2k iterations and focus on a single one with timely updates. I'm fine with the microtransactions but would've been great if I stick to a single MyPlayer for years instead of making a new one each year. Also, I wish 2k were a bit friendlier to PC users. There has been a considerable number of 2k Players who game on the PC (including me) but they still haven't catered to that market."

The game plays better than 19 and career feels like a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ career finally. There are some interesting dynamics that have been introduced and should make for an exciting year. The grind has been somewhat cut down! getting a higher overall and ranking up in park seems easier if you know how to play. The park is the same however. Minor changes but not enough to call it a brand new park. The game constantly crashes on me and Im running an i7-8700 with a Asus 2080.-. so it's not my rig. There are already people hacking which I can handle but for some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ reason, Centers are able to boost and run as fast as guards... wtf.... and that is due to the update that 2k just dropped yesterday. I could honestly go on but I'm sure the majority of you already know what I'm talking about. It's sad that we don't have many other choices but to either run 2k or not play basketball. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ have us in a tough spot. Good luck, Hoopers! I hope we can get this game fixed."

It's a copy and paste fest through and through and egregious with it's cutting corners.I'm a MY GM player and have always liked the option to build a team through trades/the draft and then play around with that team whenever I wanted to in the past games. However, with this game's god awful AP system, I cannot do that. Instead of being able to build your team and staff and play at your leisure, you're now given a quota of points and games are auto-simulated behind the scenes. You can either take control of your team and play the basketball games, OR do the team building stuff... not both like you could in past games. Why restrict a game mode this way? What was wrong with the old way of giving us GM players the option to do both if we wanted?It's garbage. Guess I'll stick with 2k19 for another year."

This year is different, two big issues right away.First: I'm not sure if everyone has this problem, but when I start in offseason in myleague and select to use the real 2019 draft class none of the rookies of the 2019 draft (ie zion, rj, morant) have scanned faces. They all have these generic faces which look roughly similar. All the attributes on them are the same, and their scanned faces do show up if I start at beginning of season, so I have no idea why this is happening.Second: I keep getting an error code: 95b37d16, which doesn't even register on the 2kstatus webpage youre supposed to check when receiving error codes.Additionally, I feel like the load times are even slower than last year, and in game advertisements for money-grabbing features are even more prevalent."

I try to enjoy this game as a realistic basketball simulation, playing mostly 5v5 vs AI. I find it hard to enjoy this game.No. The automatic playcalling option still doesn't not work. The on-going bug since atleast NBA 2k16, has not been fixed. No. As a ballhandler, you still cannot protect the ball, if you want to call a play from the playbook. Or call any offensive tactic, whatsoever.These two flaws alone should help you decide in favor of not purchasing this game. I don't realistically see anyone with any bit of basketball history, to be able to enjoy this game, due to these two afore mentioned flaws in the game alone.The ballhandler being restricted from simultaneously protecting the ball and calling a play, is claimed to be an intended functionality by the ""product support"". That feature interplays together with the automatic playcalling bug. Often times a play is automatically called, that directs AI players to bring their defenders close to the ballhandler, who is desperately trying to go through the clunky playbook UI. While restricted to be able to protect the ball. In this year's ""rendition"" of the ""game"" there is an extra layer of UI to choose and pass as you try to call a play from the playbook as a ball handler. This makes it even slower to call a play. The NBA 2k19 displayed the most lopsided AI perimeter defense. Allen Iverson was unable to dribble to the basket through the perimeter defense of the likes of Shaq. That aspect of the game has been balanced. But with this new UI rework, we stand at the same woeful situation as with NBA 2k18.I'm forced to use quotations around the words developers, game, edition, version, rendition, bug and fix. The product support claim, that known bugs will be fixed in future game versions. If it's called a _game version_, why do we have to pay full price for it, just like we would for a brand new game? On the other hand, if it's a brand new game, then why is it's functionality the exact carbon copy of its predecessor? Launched with a couple of broken features, which are then restored. Why would you call developers with the term developers, if they don't develop anything? They merely break aspects of the game, and then restore them back. They forgot to update the taskbar logo from 2k19 to 2k20. Worst gaming franchise by far."

It was what I moved to when they implimented the stories into MyPlayer. I could create said player and draft him and play through his whole career. I liked that you could customize it and that content creators could upload their rosters and/or draft classes for you to use so that you could sort of have updated rosters through a couple years (barring all the bizarre trades and the Spurs getting horrible no matter what). Along with that came customizable difficulty and sliders for contracts, trades, progression, and injuries that gave MyGM ""realism.""At his point, all the customization I loved is gone and now it forces us to compete against each other in a ranking system in a single player mode that was just there for us to mess around in. They've stripped basically all the customization out of it save for the difficulty setting. You can't even play the full 12 minute quarters. I'm sure it's still in Season Mode, but I want that little difference between that and the old MyGM mode. It was just enough immersion for me to keep coming back to the game.Another thing that kills it for me is MyPlayer. They told us that we could customize our player's progression and overall max stats individually, but that's only half true if I'm being generous. We still have to use the broken arc type system that can be abused in the Park and handicaps you in two skill areas. The only difference is that now we're even more restricted on how good our players can get because we have to allot our attributes within that arc type, and you don't enough ""upgrades"" to max out that arc type.I'm also tired of these preludes and how heavy the mode focuses on story. I like seeing all these cameos, sure, but I remember back in 2K14 when the story was minimal and didn't impede on the fun of having your character actually somewhat be you. They were a blank slate and the arc type system still allowed your character to excel at all areas. They weren't forced into a set story-line that lasts hours longer than the actual gameplay it's supposed to build around. I don't care about the story. It's not engaging; it's disruptive. Sure, you can skip through it and ignore the whole story, but I couldn't even make it that far. And I don't want to play a ton of games that aren't even in the NBA before I can get drafted.It wouldn't be such a problem to have them give us these narratives in MyPlayer or give us the new competitive MyGM mode if they would let us opt out of them for the classic versions. I can't imagine that it would even be that much work to do, they did it last year.The last thing is Microtransactions."

Am I a joke to you? What am I Markelle Fultz?- When you finally find a match in park which takes forever cuz there's no real matchmaking system only to have the game lock every person on the court so you have to force quit the game.- When your MyPlayer name is removed and changed to "" "" once you create it like it thinks you trynna be Arya Stark"

1089350,1,0,llaerrick,270,19,1,447.2,"7 September, 2019","Thankfully, I've not had some of the problems that others are having with actually running the game. Playing mostly on My Career and other than some very bad choppy frame-rate on some of the cut-scenes (and during some of the half-time/ full-time shows) the game has mostly run fine. Don't get me wrong, there a ton of bugs, but I've been lucky enough not to run into any game-breaking ones yet. That said, I put in 760+ hours on 2k19, and after only about 20 hours of 2k20, i'm wondering if it's worth putting any more time in. The MyCareer story is kind of lame. Apparently, you become the Colin Kaepernick of college hoops. Lame as it is, it was also a little too short and a total waste of Idriss Alba's talents. There are also a ton of changes to systems and my neighborhood. A short tutorial or a write up would have been useful. For eg. how do you gain reputation, changes to the physical stats, etc. The tweak to player builds is interesting. I would say the jury is out on whether this is a good or bad thing. Same with the badges (swapping out badges at will seems like a cool thing, since there are badges that may be more useful for single player and others which may be more useful if you're playing multi). Except earning them now seems a lot tougher. Also happy not needing to go into the gym after every game to get turbo, that at least is a welcome change. But the new stat progression system kind of stinks in how you cannot put points into physicals (Speed, Acceleration, Vertical, Stamina). Apparently, these physical stats and kind of tied into the other stats and they increase bit by bit as you increase the other stats. In theory that sounds ok, but this does not translate well into gameplay once your player hits the NBA. In previous games, the first thing I did was to pump all points into the physical stats. If nothing else, it allows your player to be competitive and keep up with the PC players. This time round this is not possible. The system means you generally won't hit your maximum physical stats until you're close to maxing out ALL your other stats (i.e. end-game). It means you'll be slower, weaker and jump lower than most other PC players unless you are close to max stats. That combined with the change to turbo (using it really terribly drains your stamina) means that 1/2 the time PC players are blowing by you. That's crappy when you're a wing and guarding top-stars, who waltz into the paint at will. But the time i wanted to put my fist through the monitor was when i realised that as a SG, i could not outrun a Centre on a fast break. Things like that really affect enjoyment of the game and I cannot help but cynically feel that all these changes are intended to force players to spend $ on VC to max up faster. There is a new simulation system when you are subbed out. Previously, you just press A till you are subbed in or the game ends. Now, there is a choice to watch the game play on before subbing in - but apparently, quite a few players have complained that this feature is bugged and causes the game to go into slow-mo. I've not encountered this thankfully. But the developer who decided that it should be a good idea (when simulating to sub in) to be forced to watch the last few seconds of every half if you're not subbed in should be shot. After a while, it gets tiresome.Been reading some other reviews on the changes to MyGM. They sound horrendous. After MyCareer, My GM is usually my next favourite mode. Apparently, MyGM has now become something like a mobile app game ... tl;dr, i think i hate 2K. 2."

1089350,17,33,X32WaysToDie,429,9,-1,392.2,"7 September, 2019","Wow. So, let me just start off by saying, I really don't care at all for the MyCareer/MyTeam aspects of this (anymore) thanks to 2K monetizing it and making it grindy (not to mention the cringe-worthy storylines and dialog). My bread and butter is really MyGM mode. MyLeague would be my preferred option, except every 2K for the last several years has bare-boned MyLeague in favor of MyGM, leaving out crucial features like morale changes (I benched Russ the entire first half of this season to test for instance, and his morale didn't drop one bit in MyLeague), not to mention other features such as badges on staff and other aspects. So really, there is no ""perfect"" mode for me, thanks to how 2K has broken these modes apart.Anyway, so the last several years I've been playing MyGM, because with all its flaws, it's still at the best experience available (unfortunately). 2K19's MyGM was actually fairly decent, it gave us most of the options available in MyLeague, while still retaining its own feel. It was fine. Apparently that wasn't going to fly with 2K.So fast-forward to 2K20. MyGM has been bastardized and is TOTAL GARBAGE. Gone is the ability to edit your players -- AT ALL. Want to change Ben Simmons from a PG to a SF? Can't do it. Want to make AD a PF instead of Center since LA already has Boogie and Dwight at Center? Nope, not anymore.The entire ""edit player"" option is gone in MyGM. You can no longer edit a player's number (so now if a goofy new player comes to OKC and takes #0, well, even though it's unrealistic, you're stuck with it). You can no longer designate a player as a playmaker in the edit settings. You can no longer edit their accessories. You can no longer do ANYTHING we could previously do in those settings in other iterations -- it's totally gone. I get removing the ability to edit other teams players, admittedly there were ways to really cheese the system last year, such as changing other teams' players that you wanted to crazy positions (like Andre Drummond as a PG) in order to make them tradeable, so if they had removed the ability to edit other teams' players, I would be ok with that. But you are telling me as a GM, I can't change the positions of my own players to evolve with my team? What?!On top of that, you can no longer use a custom roster anymore. Honestly, I wouldn't care much about this personally, the only reason I use it is because 2K still lists KD as 6'9, despite the fact he is clearly not and has admitted so himself, so it looks goofy seeing him next to Giannis who is 2"" taller than him in the game, even though they are the same height in real life. Also, another HUGE missing feature, is that I can no longer set the quarter length, or sim the games I play to have realistic minutes and stats, so now everything is off if I decide to play my own games (which if you don't, what is even the point of playing?). Why was this removed? It makes no damn sense. We can no longer make any other difficulty edits, other than a generic (and totally vague and unhelpful) option to select an easy, medium, or hard difficulty at the beginning, and that's it. And don't even get me started on the new ""action point"" system. I still don't understand it, and it still makes no sense, but I can already tell it's awful. Apparently, you have to do something every single day if you want to be able to even play a game -- I can't even just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ select a game to play on the calendar anymore, it won't let me. I have to do BS tasks and other things each day just to advance. The NBA season is long! I don't want to literally do hundreds of things that are mostly meaningless every season just to be able to play games I want to play. There's a lot of other things I am forgetting in the heat of the moment, and I may come back and edit this as I remember/discover more. But the main takeaway is that this game has been severely stripped down from the MyGM aspect, to the point that it is pretty much unplayable. Again, none of this would be an issue if MyLeague were given the same basic features and systems that MyGM has, such as working player morale, coaching badges, a feeling that players actually care what you do, etc, but that has been neglected for years by 2K. I suspect it's because they want people playing only modes which include options to spend VC, and if you can customize the game mode to make the league how you want it, how are they going to get money out of you? This game is really gross. I'm going to give MyGM a while longer, but I may legit ask for a refund. I keep asking myself ""why"" throughout my experience with this game. MyGM was fixed and fine last year, WHY did they strip it down and make it so restrictive? Restrictive and prohibitive is the best way to describe it. I won't be buying 2K next year. I'll wait until a decent version is cracked, and then just grab it that way. I don't care for any of the online BS because it's already been turned into a grindfest in order to milk money out of people for a game they already paid for, so in my eyes 2K did this to themselves. What a gross and disgusting company. Stay away from this game. Also, as I saw a few other people mention, this is literally such a copy-paste of 2K19, that as of this moment, the icon in the task bar when it's running still shows the 2K19 version. LMAO"

1089350,1,0,braynaz36,36,3,-1,165.3,"5 September, 2020","DISCLAIMER: I've played every NBA 2K game since 2K13, so I consider my opinion valid.Pros:NBA 2K20 is a slight upgrade from 2K19, as the graphics, movement and animation selection all seem to be better than before. Also, the story in MyCareer is pretty engaging, but it's still quite similar to those from past games.Cons:As a regular 2K player, I was pretty disappointed with NBA 2K20. The improvements were rather limited in my opinion, and the game itself was a disaster after its launch. Endless bugs and glitches plagued every game mode and feature, which actually made me uninstall until the 2K team patched some things up. Even now, though, I notice plenty of issues with game play and scene transitions.TLDR: Don't buy this game if you're expecting something new/better from 2K. Just like Madden, this is pretty much the same game as it's always been. I'd only recommend buying it if it's on sale for at least 50% off."

The single-player and multi-player team basketball game is pretty much exactly the same as it was in 2010, and the new additions have been things like MyCareer. MyCareer is a pay to win MMO basketball lifestyle RPG. The idea of building your own character and having him play for NBA teams is actually a cool idea. It's also cool to have him play online with other player's own characters in park or organized team games. But they have completely polluted it by allowing you to spend in game currency on power, and they have added more pointless â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to spend in game currency on like 300 different types of shoes, temporary consumable bonuses, and an in game casino... It is really disgraceful. If you wanted to play games and team practice to reach a competitive stat level to play against good players online, it would take hundreds of hours... Or you could simply spend $100 on in game currency and shorten that time massively. I can say with 100% certainty that the 2016 and 2017 version of this game was much better than all the subsequent games. I feel like the NBA is slapping basketball fans in the face by allowing this awful game studio to make games with their players and teams. Everyone complains about how awful EA is, but compared to this game, FIFA and Madden are incredible. As a big basketball fan, it really sucks that these are the only basketball games available to us in recent years."

The features added in myplayer creation has added flexibility in builds that we previously didn't have. I also thoroughly enjoy the new MyGm mode.In 2k19 it was practically impossible to drive on a big man, player collision was poorly done resulting in turnovers and frustration. 2K20 has mended this issue and provided the consumer with a more fluid and realistic game. The game itself feels like it has less RNG and provides a more skill based gaming experience (which is very much appreciated honestly).  Overall, pretty good for a NBA2k game."

For it to be competitive for myplayer online i can see why people are mad. It doesn't bother me a bit. Now the neighborhood experience its the same exact as 2k19 in my opinion. I don't see the difference at all. It feels a bit clunky running around and the stores really are not that great. I played the Myplayer story and i liked it. Some parts were confusing and didn't really seem like a real players experience to me. Over all good acting and game play. On the court it sometimes feel clunky just like 2k19 but feels faster and more like a basketball simulation. So from playing Madden football and playing this,  NBA2K is by far the better game. Football i love more than anything but this game is a better all around package. If you played madden you know what I'm saying. If you like solo play and just want to work on Myplayer or play franchise mode this game is for you. I also think this game gets a bad rep because there is always so many problems when released. I've even said I'll never pay full price again and haven't for a few years till 2k20. I feel its a great game and the graphics are amazing.

Right now, in its current state, the game is not at all playable. The first thing you notice is it takes forever just to connect after you download. When you get into the game, even on my 4K computer, it runs with latency. At 4k resolution, the game will not let you run faster than 30 mhz refresh rate. At 60 mhz and at about half resolution, the frame rate is terrible even on low settings. The game videos do not play but instead give you a choppy green screen. If you get passed all that and can get to MyPlayer and make a character, you'll find more issues. The menus do not always work. Especially when simply trying to exit. Hit A. Nothing happens. You have to minimize and then close the application and restart. So you're building a player. Sometimes it will let you choose what he looks like and sometimes it'll just send you straight to ability making. After you choose your position, your ratings for various stats, etc, and you save your player, when you go to load it, you will something else. Like I made a Shooting Guard that can Slash to the basket. I ended up with a Small Forward with a different ability. I made a center playmaker and ended up with a Center paint defender.  With my center, I was shooting deep 3's and did not miss a single shot. On either player I created, I did not miss a shot. I did not play very many minutes, but still did not miss a shot in maybe a dozen or more attempts. After all of this, I decided to ask for a refund, so unaware of what other problems there lies in other modes of the game or further along in a game or in MyStory mode beyond a few minutes. I am sure there are other issues. This has been my experience with this product."

Plus I encounter a problem where I finished the story in my career mode and I'm on the start of the 2019-2020 NBA season, only to find out that my player has no name.

I haven't played since 2k15, so I thought that even though people are saying it is the same game, that enough time had passed for me to enjoy some new things. I tried 20 times to upload a face scan using their absolute garbage app that also forced me into some card game and made me click through 20 store pop-ups and complete the game in order to go back to the menu (even force quitting the app brings you back to the card game when you reopen). Every time I uploaded my face scan, it would say error and then make me do another face scan. I got sick of it not working, so I created a player based off a face in the game. During the customization, it skips a bunch of things I would want to change, and locks in a semi-customized player. I played career mode for 20 minutes and cringed and found myself skipping the cutscenes since they were so cheesy and obvious. I thought I would delete my career and try again today for making a player. I deleted my career, and when I went to start a new career, it had that same semi-customized player locked in without any way for me to make a new player or change the appearance. All of that, on top of players pictures showing them in their old jerseys when this game released 3 months after the trade happened. Lazy game that from what I played, seemed clunkier than 2k15 and is full of dumb stuff they didn't even bother to check."

There has been a lasting and an unresolved problem with playing online and with the card tiles in MyTeam mode. Some including myself have experienced the problem where the controller and keyboard and mouse stop working once you have joined an online game. This means you cannot control your players or any others. Since this has no fix and 2K doesn't care i and many others cannot play online with anyone including close friends. This is a serious cause of irritation and i'm frankly surprised with how good 2K sales are when there customer service is so terrible. They make the same game every year and everyone still buys it. The only reason i got it is because of my friends and because it was 5$. I like MyCareer in most sports games but i still play with my friends and this game doesn't allow me and other dissatisfied customers to do so. Fix your game 2K or start making them correctly the first time.

1089350,0,0,Renster23,228,38,-1,169.8,"3 September, 2020","This game has a game breaking bug where when you tap the shoot button no matter how quickly you tap or press it, it shoots a very late release shot. Even if you just want to pump fake. This extends to the free throws at times which is beyond annoying because you have zero influence on how likely your shot is to go in. On top of that 2k has never had anti-cheat which ruins the game in online the park is full of cheaters it's a shock every time I get a game the doesn't have a hacker. The only other game I've played where cheating is nearly as bad as on this game is gta 5 and rdr2 and both of those games share a parent company with this game in take two interactive. It's extremely buggy with the graphics settings on pc when you turn down some settings there is a bug where the entire neighborhood has the same pitch black texture except for signs and players. The game is just packed full of bugs, such as in mycareer when you are subbed out and there is supposed to be a button to sim until the next appearance which will fail to appear for extreme lengths of time if your game is not capped at 60fps and sometimes crashes due to it making you lose what you've done for that game. The game is capped at 60fps for the online modes which on top of horrendous servers makes the online gameplay run like a handicapped geriatric when compared to the single player and I haven't even mentioned how often you will be disconnected for no reason at all. Another very fun bug is how in online games you sometimes just randomly deal with framerate stutters of dropping from 60 to <10fps which will persist throughout the entire game you play. I really want to recommend this game to friends because I genuinely have a great time playing this game when everything is working. It has so much more potential on pc however, there is no support for voice chat on pc, we don't get the demo for the next game. We get the next gen releases a year late, and despite that we are subject to the same predatory pricing and monetization as the consoles which are supported so much more. The basketball gameplay usually improves year after year but I am disappointed every year due to the utter neglect and silence that 2k treats the PC platform to making version of the game with the most potential into the version of the game with the most headaches and I do not see that ever changing in the foreseeable future."

Although the ability to build multiple builds using the pie chart system makes it a proper immersive grind. I suggest grinding one build at a time. Find the one that works for you early and just push those badges.As always pay to win quicker is a massive thing in park and pro am as always in the 2k franchise, it is easier still though to push a 95 overall. But, that also creates the issue where you have to push to a legend in the park to reach your 99 overall cap breakers.All in all a good game and for the price i paid at Â£3.20, you cant complain. Although its a grind I've managed to reach a 92 overall in just 96 hours of play, which shows it is do able and i haven't invested a tonne of money on VC. Play smart until you're able to beast mode on the court and you will get those badges up quick, and that my friends, is the key to winning in this game. Badges beat stats but stats do help some :)"

Admittedly I haven't had an nba game in some time, but the mechanic for career mode in this game is ludicrous you get ""vc"" which you use to upgrade your stats, but with the starter stats your player can't hit an open look midrange shot as a point guard if your shot timing is even one iota off of perfect. Luckily you can pay extra money to buy VC to upgrade your player or grind through four or five NBA seasons to get the needed coin to make career mode playable. At $80 this is a farce."

My favorite gamemode is MyCAREER, Where the cutscenes are really good, with an exciting storyline. I would recommend this for people who have played FIFA, and liked to play their  Manager/Player career mode, since i think NBA's storymode is better."

I wrote a rather nasty review, but instead of leaving it, I wanted to put this warning out there and offer a more constructive posting rather than just saying to not buy the game. Given my experience with this one, I am not planning on buying from this developer again.NOW THE HELP PORTION:IF you decide to buy this game and install it, when the game launches for the first time, it is going to ask for your date of birth. There is a minimum age requirement to access online game play, HOWEVER, you would think it should be easy to put in your correct birthday. IT IS NOT. The menu has Month, Day, and Year top to bottom. There are hash marks in the fields where the birthday goes and arrows on each side. You can cycle through the months and days with the arrows just fine, BUT BE CAREFUL WITH THE YEAR! If you click the right arrow, the game will stop you right there and give you a message that says you are too young to play online and the online features will be LOCKED!!! USE THE LEFT ARROW TO SELECT THE YEAR OF YOUR BIRTHDAY!!!!!I've read the game is full of pay to win micro-transactions that give people an advantage with programming mechanics of the game I do not even know of yet, but I don't really care about any of that. Rubbish purchases are just that and are designed to accommodate plebs. People who want shortcuts in life are the problem and they are the reason game companies get by with doing what they do. If you don't enjoy playing with those types of people, I would suggest only playing with friends who you know view games the same as you. Let the rest of the riffraff battle with their wallets.I ultimately had to make a return to steam and re-purchase the game in order to enter my correct birthday. I spent a lot of time reading forums and trying various other methods in order to remedy the problem, and I even requested help from the Dev, but in the end the return and re-buying seemed my only timely solution. I did manage to pick the game up cheap, but considering how much money I make per hour when I am working, I definitely overpaid.Buy the game or don't. I just hope this helps at least one person to not make the same mistake. Good luck!"

HOWEVER, it is in no way worth the 100+ GB download space. I could download Skyrim 5 times but instead I have this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The game crashes at LEAST 3 times a day and sometime crashes on startup twice in a row before I can finally play.1. MyCareerGood god. The story itself is quite good in some spots, but it's ruined by many things, the constant cutscenes which are just needless in some spots. You go from cutscene to cutscene, play 2 mins worth of game and another cutscene. Some parts seem like they were written by a 5 year old, needless cringe jokes and bad puns between characters leave you feeling just plain awkward. When it comes to player improvement, it has never been slower. I saw some post where you have to play for about 120-130 HOURS before you MyPlayer reaches max attributes. It's just one giant push to make you spend more money. 2. MyTeam Yawn, It's still just the same old gamemode that 2k has had for years. I'm not much of a PvP kind of person so I was hoping for at least a little bit of fun against the CPU. Nope, there are hundreds of single-player challenges to choose from, allow me to walk you through them. Step 1. Try and beat team. Step 2. Beat team because the game puts it on Rookie difficulty. Step 3. Repeat Step 1 except the difficulty is one level higher. Oh no, my 30 point win is now only a 25 point win. So much harder. Step 4. Log off after 2 games because you get bored of playing the CPU on Rookie difficulty. That's MyTeam in a nutshell. 3. MyGMEh, It's a GM mode, I like it.Overall, 2.5/10. Wait till it's 5 bucks."

Read a lot of negative comments about this game and I was iffy on whether or not to get it even at under $7CDN.It looks good on my computer.  Gameplay wise I can't complain for the price.There is a weird sound issue as in there's no sound at all from the game when using HDMI as my out audio source.  There's fixes online and stuff but if I just use my wired headphones and plug them into the computer as mu output sound source then the game has sound again.All in all Ive been plaing sports games for a looooooooooooooooooooooooooong time and this game offers what I would expect to get out of it as an OG gamer.

Year after year they keep getting away with video game industry crimes becouse die hard NBA fans will buy their game anyway. Offline modes are fine, MyCareer storyline is short but i liked it. After charging you 60 bucks for the game they still constantly try to force you to pay more (i played 530 hours and still havent got a single 90 overall myplayer). If you wanna play online modes you may as well buy a console, 2K doesnt give a sh_t about the PC version, the servers are utter trash, i get 30 ping on other games but on 2K it feels like 200 when playing online. Along side with input lag online modes also often drop fps, freeze and crash. I would only recomend you buy the game if you primerly wanna play offline."

1089350,1,0,FICTiVETRUiSM,450,5,-1,7.7,"29 August, 2020","First time playing an NBA 2K game since 2K13 on the PS3. I hear people say the modern 2K games are bad, but I always thought that was a bit of an exaggeration. After playing 2K20, I can say that I can see where they are coming from. I feel like the core gameplay is flawed on some key areas. I have to say graphically and presentation wise the looks fantastic. But gameplay wise I feel like the game's need to feel realistic takes away a lot of fun. Team AI is atrocious, I feel like you can't rely on your AI teammates to play good defense especially in the paint. Players are too slow to simulate ""realistic"" fatigue, it ends up feeling like your trapped into what 2K wants instead of relying on skill. It makes fast breaks and help defense feel lethargic.Which bring me to the main point about the core gameplay. I often times felt like I was trapped in animations to ""simulate"" momentum. This makes the game feel kinda like the movement in a GTA game. So like your player is still moving a bit after you've moved the analog stick, which can make for some frustrating defensive one-on-one sequences.I also need to mention the gambling/microtransactions in the game, which is a whole other issue. I was under the assumption that once you got an player's card for MyTeam, that he was yours to keep. But nope, you have to constantly sign them to 1 or 5 game contracts to play with them. This gets in the way of fun and just another design choice to nudge gamers towards buying the microtransaction currency. It's a shame because I really wanted to like this game. I feel like 2K has all the money and talent to make stellar basketball games again. For now I guess I'll stick with the flawed but more fun NBA 2K11 until NBA 2K improves their core gameplay mechanics."

It remains the best basketball PC experience you can get , but 2K shoot themselves in the foot with constantly asking for more money (despite the astronomical price tag to begin with - if you paid full price). A lot of the game was cut and paste of previous years' editions. Park and neighbourhood modes are disappointing. MyGM was also confusing and came up a bit short. With myCareer , it starts well  , but the game play becomes grind-y and the commentary is extremely repetitive. Micro-transactions abound (as usual over the last few years' instalments) - it's not even worth arguing the point anymore. The profits outweigh any player concerns so the companies will never listen anyway. I especially found the ""2kTV mini-episodes"" unbelievably annoying - it's basically an ad for 2k21 before EVERY game you play with two over-enthusiastic hosts , against whom your rage meter will slowly but surely build up. Saying asinine things like ""2020 had its challenges but thank god for 2k"" .... really? After a while (unless you're a purist 2k fan)  you will put the controller down out of sheer annoyance - usually an hour or two in.  However , it is a testament to the quality of offline game play that you go back for second and third servings , knowing that annoyance will return. It 's a form of masochism. All in all the game is fun So yes , recommended....kinda.... as long as you play offline and buy it on sale. Definitely not worth USD $60 or 50 euros they're charging. I was able to look past many of the flaws because I got the game for $5 on sale. I'm sure if I had paid full price I would have been fuming."

Check.After I noticed the character and graphics issues after the absurdly long ingame update, I quitted and uninstalled and asked for a refund. FIFA football series of EA sucks.

1089350,0,0,7.65612E+16,240,30,-1,14,"27 August, 2020","I play these games for MyCareer, saw it on special, and even though the last one was disappointed decided to give it a shot. At first I was impressed. I loved the story, and the storytelling through the camera. The animations had improved drastically. The actual game looks pretty good too. Everything through that point feels great. The games themselves feel okay, the shooting isn't awful, and you can find yourself doing quite well in the NBA Summer League to finish things off. I think the story is short but sweet. Not worth it on its own, but a really big step up from 2K16 which was the last game I played.Then you hit the NBA, and the game shows its true colours. It feels just as bad as it did before, except maybe worse. Shot timing in this game specifically is the worst I have experienced. In other games, being slightly late or slightly early meant that an open shot would almost always go in. In this game, anything but an excellent shot will almost always miss. I understand wanting to make controls precise, but this is awful. Next, dribbling feels super clumsy for My Player. He isn't decked out on the stats, but as a shooting guard who was a big star through your college years, you should at least expect him to be able to cross over without losing control of the ball, or do a spin dribble with some speed. But the problem is, everything you think you should be able to do, you can't.I don't want to grind for 100+ hours to deck out my stats just so I can maybe have a little fun with the career games. I don't care for any other aspect of the game, so this was yet again, not worth it. There are minor improvements, and some major setbacks from the last entry I played. With this, and the fact that 2K is as greedy as they are with microtransactions, I don't recommend this game. It's utterly infuriating, and not in a good way. This game looks fantastic for a sports game, manages to create a good atmosphere for basketball fans, and has a wide variety of tasks and activities to do, but the core gameplay lacks a lot of the fundamentals of a good video game. This game is not fun unless you really want to dedicate your full time into it or pay into the microtransactions this game is riddled with."

My only real problem with the mode is just that it felt like the story was too short. One minute I'm in college, the next I'm on the Rockets while sitting on a plane talking to Lebron.The gameplay is as fluid as my pee, and the animations seems to go well together.

And the negatives -limited WNBA features.                               -my team seems to be mainly a cash grab.                              - you do not seem to be able to lock on players in some important modes(practice) and it is hard to learn the game when you can lock players in some modes and not others.                              -no game manual or in game glossary to help you learn the game   ---------Final thoughts--------------------------------------------------------------This game has a lot of potential and if the make NBA2k21 add full features to the WNBA that are in NBA (create a player ,my league,my carrier ,edit uniforms,hairstyles ,faces ,(voices ?)able to make expansion teams that you can edit arenas,uniforms ect.I would buy it (even for 100$!  )"

Even then, your player starts off at the worst possible stats and can barely shoot or dribble and somehow makes it in the NBA. Then, for you to level up your character, you have to grind vc coins which is made to be  as slow as possible so you get sick and tired and buy vc points to upgrade YOUR STORY MODE CHARACTER. It doesn't make any sense! What makes it worse, is the clumsy physics and character models. It feels like you have no control of your character and doing any type of drunks leaves you with little to no satisfaction. literally a 2/10 game.

I have not bought a NBA2k game since 2016 because nothing has really gotten any better since then. And the micro-transactions have just gotten worse. I almost feel bad at whoever paid full price for this and has to grind like crazy or pay an  exorbitant price for VC. It honestly makes no sense that you even have the option to pay for VC for a single player mode, but to have the VC drip fed to people that actually want to earn it the way that you should in a game is almost extortion considering  early attributes can effect your entire first season. This is beyond GTA online levels of bad."

1089350,3,0,Kinazoko,101,1,1,354.2,"24 August, 2020","OK this is my first time writing the review for NBA 2K series.  I have played NBA 2K franchise since 2K13. So  I will give you the review from me.Pros :1. Updated Roster : Well this is must be the advantage of buying the original version of game than the pirate. The update well i can say that the update is often when the real NBA roster make an Update. For example, when the Player in real NBA was traded, shortly after the trade, the player will be in the new team. For me this is very useful when you playing Quick Play.2. Easier shot meter. I don't know how the people maybe against this, but for me NBA 2K20 is easier than the NBA 2K series before. Well, I'm mostly played this game for Quick Match and I can say this point is in my pros because I almost used all of the team available (include the WNBA) 3. The Story in MyCarrer. So in MyCarrer we played as ""Che"" who was a Captain in the Bay City Team. Somehow I love the story. 4. MyCarrer Stat : OK maybe this is kinda weird BUT you will never increase the meter in Team Takeover while you score the most point. For me, this is very good. You just cannot make point as much as you want but if you get the point from assists or from offensive rebound the takeover meter will increase. The summary is a lot of point is not to important for takeover the team. Team Takeover for me is when you useful for the team not just be the STAT PADDER5. Updated Team Play : Well lets make a comparison between NBA 2K20 and NBA 2K18 (i dont buy NBA 2K19 because in that time my hardware was not support). I am using Dallas Mavericks NBA roster and have very significantly different in play style (or Team Play or Run Play or whatever it is called). In NBA 2K18 you will run the play mostly in first Option is the PF position. in NBA 2K20, you will run the play more equally (equally in this meaning of all player in the court will have the same proportion of play). Cons (Here comes)1. MICROTRANSACTION : well this is mostly every player will know this game as the HIGH MICROTRANSACTION. You will be know when you go to Park in MyCarrer. Almost every player has 90++ overall rating and I don't know how the hell they can be fast in increasing the overall. Well I played the MyCarrer at least 50 hour and i got 83 rating for PF.2. NETWORK CONNECTION : oh come on, 2K fix the connection in online session. I never played so smooth in every online session (MyTeam, Park, and anything who need connection with another player). Well in my case is the connection is when I make a Shot. The Shot Meter always delay and i dont know why.SO LETS  GO TO THE CONCLUSION :Why you must buy this :1. Frequent Update Roster2. Story of MyCarrer will be different every year3. Gameplay will be different Every YearWhy you not buy this :1. Played mostly for online play and want to increase the overall fast by MICROTRANSACTION2. Don't have a stable connection for Online (or at least have bad connection)Advice*when you play the MyCarrer, just follow the team play. If you want to be star of the team just follow it at first. Don't be hurry for be a star. Increase the minute playing by obey the team play. The easier is you must turn on the run play setting (I forgot the name) and just follow that. If you follow that, it will be a good play."
1089350,0,0,Xeroze,275,3,-1,29.6,"24 August, 2020","See all those negative reviews? Well, here's one more to add to that list.Bought it at 90 something % discount. Still not recommended to purchase. The game is worse than every iteration of the game since my previous purchase (2k17) and that version has been worse that the version before it. 2k is literally the only developer who manages to release a new game every year that is WORSE than the previous year and still manage to sell. So what's worse?-AI is even worse now, half the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ time when you're driving your moronic AI teamates will.... run up into you, blocking you and bringing a double team. Doesnt matter if you have a full 5-out team, they will INSIST on running into you. Call a pick and they will HEDGE for the opposing team and prevent you from driving. -Reverse is true on defense. When opponents do a pick, good luck running through two picks, one of which might be an illegal screen done by your own teammate.-Everything is worse. Everything is tuned to be more VC focused, and no way to earn VC easily. And even if you earn the VC well enough with enough gameplay, the gameplay itself is still â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ than previous iterations. Mycareer mode limitations prevent you from even creating NBA star level players even if you max everything out. Wont be able to recreate AD, KD, Lebron, or whatever guy you wanna play as in mycareer because ""competitive play"" which doesnt really exist because cheaters/hackers galore. TL;DR: bad game even at 9x% discount. Dont even bother spending 5 bucks to buy this game. I spent 5 bucks and 29 hours just so you dont have to and can instead spent it on ice cream, popcorn, or bacon. And you will definitely enjoy any of those stuff more."

1089350,0,0,7.65612E+16,158,6,-1,7.3,"24 August, 2020","Haven't really played many current gen sports games, but this does not inspire confidence in the genre. About as cashgrabby as the sims, only with the sims, at least you aren't forced into a horrible online mode, and the cashgrabbing isn't as pervasive. Single player mode is forced online, and everything costs VC which you can buy for real money, or spend several hours of your life trying to earn in order to come close to having a competitive chance. Everything from your character's attributes to the clothes they wear costs this currency and the kicker is they've hidden a lot of the customisation behind the online gameplay, forcing you to grind not only VD but also 'rep' points to unlock things like animations and rides and customisation options for your court. Basically all the fun is taken out of Single player mode, and stashed behind a paywall. Want to ride a skateboard around the neighborhood? Not only do you have to unlock it by playing online games until you grind enough rep levels, but you also have to grind about sixty to seventy thousand VC points to buy one. And the VC you get for doing things is abysmal. If you skip the story part you get placed into a team of your choosing but only make 500VC per game, without factoring in any bonuses. Otherwise you might start with something like 750VC per game. Even if you get a thousand per game that's still sixty games worth of VC you're trading in for one skateboard. Clothes cost anywhere between a few hundred to several thousands of VC, and you can't find shoes for less than a few thou. It's done this way to encourage people to pay real $$ of course, but it's infuriating nevertheless. They dangle special events and lottery spinner things in front of you, to keep you thinking and hoping you could get a big pay-out, but the most I ever won was a few hundred VC.Then there's the team mode, and if you thought the moneygrabbing bull stopped in the career mode, you thought wrong. Instead of just letting you make a team and maybe go through a season, train the players and stuff and sort of play this sports sim, it's basically a card game where you can buy cards with (you guessed it) real money (if you want of course. You can always grind for hours and hours instead). There's another mode where you take control of as many teams as you want, in a league, and play up to the championship. This is like the only mode that has no online and nothing you can really buy, It's also the least polished and most time-consuming. Though it's the one that gives you the most freedom, basically. You get to edit players and their attributes and stuff, and teams, from their names to their stadiums. it's really closer to team mode than team mode is. Team mode you draw cards and pick your best ones and hope you get enough contract extensions to cover another game (because each game is a whole contract year basically, and you have each player card for a limited # of games, unless you put an unlimited contract on them, which are rare and expensive af, as you can probably imagine). It's not all cons, there's a few pros. The voice acting is great from most of the actors (the basketball players are about as good as you can expect, I suppose). Some characters are better than others (Isa is great. The agent is barf) though. The graphics are good and the visuals are pretty nice for the most part. The story is decent but there's a lot of cringe. Music is meh. Not my type, really, but not really bad either, apart from the odd artist I dislike. Overall, it's not a horrible game but it's nowhere near 'good'. The single player mode being online was a huge mistake. The VC system is ridiculous too. Lag is a big issue. But the main problem with the game is that it's just not fun. So much boring, time-consuming grinding. So much is locked away to push the VC-buying through the online stuff, which is dead anyway because of just how horrible it's implemented in the first place. You've barely got anybody to play with in my country and those you do find, wont touch you unless you have spent dozens of hours grinding your overall first. So before you can grind online you need to grind offline in other modes unless you want to tank your player's chances in the league for good with your terrible starting stats. It's just ridiculous.I can't rec this game to anybody. Not even masochists."

I had a bug where the game would not simulate to your next appearance so you're forced to watch the game from the bench in real time. Apparently this problem has existed since release and a year later and they still have not fixed it. Another problem I had with MyPlayer mode is that you can only improve physical stats once per week, and it's not in-game weeks but REAL TIME weeks. Bruh 2K22 would come out by the time my player becomes serviceable.EDIT: All the glitches were gone and the game became playable so for the sale price I got it for, it was worth it.

I will say this for the game, the My Player story mode was a lot of fun. I really liked the struggle of moving up the draft order. However, all of my enjoyment of the game ended when that story mode ended. I read mentions of the AI cheating, which I normally would assume would be the response of an angry gamer who lost. I've been that guy plenty of times, but it turns out the AI actually DOES cheat in this game. Honestly, after the story mode ended, I noticed how the games fluctuated with one consistency, my teammates were terrible. You could have star players on your team, but then you sit on a bench, and any lead you might have completely falls apart. 28 point lead? How about we take that away and put you 4 points behind the opposing team? Are you playing smart and picking apart the defense and  getting yourself in position? Well, now your character will shift as slow as the tectonic plates, allowing God and everyone else hit you and deny you the point. The ""Report Card"" will even chide you with a ""Bad Shot Choice"", because how dare you not assume the game would cheat to win. It all comes across as an obvious cash grab, because it forces people who want to make their characters better to pay money for VC. The game even tries to wrangle you into this during MyPlayer. This is ridiculous. Do not buy this game if you want to actually enjoy a basketball experience. Frankly, I would avoid buying most Sports games. The developers recognize that they have a audience that they can count on to buy their games every year, and they will milk as much money out of you as humanely possible. I will make a point to never buy any 2K games again."

1089350,1,0,7.65612E+16,71,5,1,83.8,"22 August, 2020","So I am gonna review the park aspect of the game since that's all I played.So if you're gonna try to play park legit you are gonna have a bad time. I would say 99% of the players on park cheat and modify their stats, badges and rep. Although people do cheat to have max attributes and badges most keep their height and wingspan legit as long as you are a PG, SG, SF and PF. Centers are always 7'3 with speed and handles and if you do not have a center you will lose 95% of the time. You will run into people who modify their wingspan beyond what is possible but it doesn't happen so often and most people get off when they see one of those cheaters.Now like I mentioned everyone modifies their rep to Legend because it gives you VIP spot if you're not in a squad. That means if you do not modify your rep you will get kicked out of your spot A LOT so be patient in finding a game or get a squad going.Now the player base. The player is base is freaking garbage 9/10 times the people you play against are just terrible. Squad or no squad. Makes the console noobs look like they are actually decent. Because of all the cheating these trash players think they can play Park like MyCareer and just try to go through you and dunk or just spam dribbles just to miss while you never get the ball. I know it sounds the same like consoles but just imagine it ten times worse.If your overall is not at least 90 you will get in the way and that's the honest truth maybe if your 3 is high enough to hit consistently you'll be a spot up shooter. Anything else if you don't cheat you better just give up.If you're gonna play Park legit do yourself a favor and buy the  console version instead if you have one, if not you're not gonna have fun. Also you're gonna hear constant helicopter if you find a game which is also not fun.Other than that the park runs smooth at 60 FPS and is way superior to consoles obviously even the gameplay.5/10 because most online players in 2k are so bad that even with cheating they are worse would not recommend. PEOPLE CANNOT AND DO NOT KNOW HOW TO PLAY DEFENSE IN THIS GAME. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD LEARN HOW TO PLAY DEFENSE. SOME PEOPLE ARE SO DUMB THEY LEAVE THESE CHEATERS OPEN ALL DAY AND THEY DRAIN 3's NON STOP SO IF YOU LIKE LOSING GET THIS GAME."

I mostly bought it for myCareer, and got about 3-4 hours into my playthrough and was getting decently immersed. and then, all of a sudden, I get drafted by a team and get into the NBA, and the game won't let me simulate when my player isn't on the court. if I want to be able to simulate the game to the point that I can ACTUALLY PLAY IT, I have to tab out of the game 5-6 times and then it will suddenly give me the option. when you start the game, you are just a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ scrub that sits on the bench because you have like 60 overall rating. so essentially, I spent $4 on a brick because anytime I want to play the myCareer mode, I get to play for about 1-2 minutes before I'm subbed out and have to start trying to force the game to actually work like it should. I've tried all of the fixes I've seen online. none of them work, in fact they just tank the game down to about 10 fps.the devs over at 2K games are actually genius, because I have to spend about 4 hours going through pointless dramatics just to be drafted and actually start getting subbed out. so this issue is not even apparent until after you cannot refund the game. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the devs for allowing this to still go unpatched for over a year, and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the Lakers. this is what will cause people to start pirating your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ games."

MyPlayer can't hit wide open slightly late/early shots with a 70 overall, but another player with a 60 overall can hit 70% contested shots. I really want to know where is the logic in this game because so far after many attempts i have failed to find it. Every team plays with the ball very selfishly not willing to pass to me while im open in paint. Every time i ask a player to pass the ball to me, i get ignored with no obvious reason behind it. As an examle, Trae Young can hold the ball for 8 seconds with nothing happening and he causes no violation, but if i hold it for 8 seconds, i get 6 different violations and my score goes from C to F+. Hitting a green shot is rarer than your parents buying you a Bugatti for your 16th birthday. Defense of the AI is non-existent. If i go for a layup i get guarded by the whole team like im a national threat with a bomb in my hand meanwhile a SF from the opposite team can score a 3 while being wide open because why not. The AI teammates block you while you are trying to get to the player you are guarding while he is moving at 300 miles per hour and then its your fault and you get a defensive breakdown. Upgrading your player does as much good as drinking acid. The movement is garbage, the animations are trash, and i could very well see why Ronny 2K would sell the game for 4 euros. I am honestly surprised at why would new players buy it. Even 4 euros is expensive for a game thats about as good as a game developed by a rookie programmer. I mean hey there must be a few positives right? Sike you thought. If this game is ""good"" then im also 8 foot 9 irl. I dont know why i thought that it would be a good idea to purchase this game.

I mostly bought it for myCareer, and got about 3-4 hours into my playthrough and was getting decently immersed. and then, all of a sudden, I get drafted by a team and get into the NBA, and the game won't let me simulate when my player isn't on the court. if I want to be able to simulate the game to the point that I can ACTUALLY PLAY IT, I have to tab out of the game 5-6 times and then it will suddenly give me the option. when you start the game, you are just a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ scrub that sits on the bench because you have like 60 overall rating. so essentially, I spent $4 on a brick because anytime I want to play the myCareer mode, I get to play for about 1-2 minutes before I'm subbed out and have to start trying to force the game to actually work like it should. I've tried all of the fixes I've seen online. none of them work, in fact they just tank the game down to about 10 fps.the devs over at 2K games are actually genius, because I have to spend about 4 hours going through pointless dramatics just to be drafted and actually start getting subbed out. so this issue is not even apparent until after you cannot refund the game. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the devs for allowing this to still go unpatched for over a year, and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the Lakers. this is what will cause people to start pirating your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ games."

And I can honestly say that this one is the worst one I've played. I know the users have been saying this is a glorified roster patch for 50 bucks. I would say this version is not worth it even with the sale. Match engine is made horribly making me question (yet again) the development capability as much as their knowledge of football altogether. They clearly wanted to implement the line breaking with throughs, but they didn't have the capability to code the defender's to react so they made the 1 on 1 chances : scoring ratio ridiculously high to offset that. I think this may be the last FM series I would purchase because it's never been this clear that Sports Interactive actually doesn't care at all about the user feedback."

1100600,0,0,7.65612E+16,20,1,1,226.6,"9 May, 2020",Best version of FM for quite a few years. Didn't bother with FM19 but FM20 is a definite big improvement from FM18. The new development area is a huge plus and I like the Club Vision page which breaks down how well you are performing in your role. Feedback from staff is much better integrated in these new versions and the tactics area is vastly improved.Match Engine still could do with improvement however and the Press Conferences have barely changed in a decade with the same cookie-cutter responses. That area really needs an overhaul. Overall it's a definite recommend especially if you've been away from the series for a couple of years.

1100600,1,0,7.65612E+16,34,1,1,660.7,"7 May, 2020","Overall I am a fan of the FM games, as I still seem to pay for them year on year. There are many comments here regarding the price for the game, I think the price is OK, given the depth of the game in terms of content and replayability. A few minor points to pick out for those that have played it over the years. Pro's:- You do feel more in control of your team than in previous years. Through the interactions, youth development, tactics and new staff roles added. Loan Manager = much needed when I get a bit excited with my first big budget. - Great lower league experience. I think the game is best played bottom up. Starting with a low level team (I started with Dulwich Hamlet). It can get very same-y if you start with a decent team. Cons:- Promises promises. Some of the mechanisms and potential responses to player promises are lacking. For example, I signed a player and promised to strengthen my team. I did (well I thought I did), I was unbeaten for the season and champions league (up to this point) and the player still complained and wanted to leave. Therefore the player rationale was based on reputation of players, rather than performance of players signed. This happened a few times therefore I stopped promising players anything before I signed them (which meant losing a few). - I am not sure if it was just my game, however after being 7-8 seasons in, there was an abundance of world class 17-20 year old strikers coming through. When checking the top scorers of the leagues, they were all created in game and all had ridiculous stats. I would compare it to 8 or 9 Messis coming through at once? WILL SOMEBODY THINK OF THE CHILDREN - Press conferences. Eventually the questions become very, very repetitive and you will always have the same answer for the same question. If you leave it to the Assistant Manager, they tend to go rogue every now and then, therefore perhaps some way to automate, but in line with some preferences would be good."

The game is a bit pricey, seeing how it's basically the same game every year, but â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, I need those new rosters.

Game mechanics are retarded. A lot of players go brain dead in corner of the area, Players just go through each other, Games follow a very fixed scenario(e.g you score then concede a goal on 82-84 min. always on 82-84min. and that happens like 10 game in a row)Some outside of the pitch mechanics are messed up too. such as player improvements.

It is unrealistic and I have tested this game playing a loss 2-3 times in a row by restarting the game without saving and managed to win most of my games because of their useless programming algorithm, this game promotes the other team more, it wants you to lose. Looking at this company in detail, they have made NO progress as a company in over 15+ years which tells me that they have only a loyal fan base and not a large player base like most games. Their lazy attitude of making a quick buck over actually making a very good game and taking pleasure in programming an excellent game just goes to show how naÃ¯ve their fan base is."

I actually wonder why since I am not aware of a patch that should have fixed these flaws.All-in-all, I really love playing this version now. In many ways (more user friendly interface, more information on how things work, more information on setting up tactics, more realistic moves of players in the match engine and curled crosses!) it is better than the 2018 version I used to play."

Game ran really well on my laptop that is less than a year old, which is use for work every day and also complete all my open university on as well. So when my trial was up i thought why not, so i spent Â£39.99 on the game. 232hrs later the game has decided not to work or when it does its slow and takes 25 mins to complete 1 game. Ive been online and checked everything i need to ref my system etc making sure everything was up to date. Gave FM20 priority you name i have tried it. Contacted Steam, no good what so ever. Went direct to Sega who told me to try everything i have been doing. To be honest im disappointment in the product and service. The game itself is great and lots of fun and kills time, but the service afterwards is a disgrace and both Steam and Sega should be ashamed of themselves. Biggest waste of Â£39.99 ever and based on my experience i wouldnt not recommend the game, no for the game itself but for the teams that claim to run/own the game. Worst companies ever and if i was any advertisement or name linked to the game and the game makers i would not want my name linked to it. I can see why Juventus never wanted to be involved.

Decided to purchase this one bcz of positive feedback. Only to see that players at England Championship level doing things that in real life you'll not see from player at League two level. Defenders will kick the ball to coner whenever they meet the ball near the back line. Strikers and wingers will try to score from impossible angles instead of passing the ball across. AI will score in added time every fourth/fifth game while you will score a goal in last minutes once a season. Defenders  stay cool while opposite striker paves his way for the shot. Keeper throwing the ball directly to the opposite striker leg - how often you see this in real life? Maybe once a season, here, in FM it happens frequent (remember we're talking about Championship level players)... and a lot of other ridiculous things that I just have no time to describe here...Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of cool stuff around the match, but when it comes to the match itself the gameplay is ruined...This is my last buy of this seriesNew update: Forget about broken match engine. The entire game is broken. At one day, after you've worked hard to bring your team to where you are, the game will start crashing with ""FM 2020 encoutered  a serious problem and will close"" message. You'll not be able to load this save anymore. Then after going back to a very old save,  one day, out of the blue, the game will start crashing with ""FM 2020 stopped working (staging) and will close"". No recover from this... DO NOT BUY."

1100600,9,1,floatingembers,94,2,1,239.6,"21 April, 2020","Football Manager is one of those sporting based franchises which receive a yearly rendition, with what looks like from the outside, nothing more than just a roster refresh. To an extent, that is true with Football Manager, with the database updated for the 2019/2020 football season, a seemingly insignificant change to justify Â£30 more of your money. However, what Sports Interactive are consistently capable of, is bringing a range of quality of life improvements as well as the occasional larger update that don't necessarily reinvent the wheel, but refine it to it's truest form.Football Manager 2020 is the best version of Football Manager, hand down, in the same way that Football Manager 2021 will most likely surpass the present iteration of the game. If you are a new player to the franchise, the in game tutorials and menus allow any user to customise and change the many different roles and responsibilities to their liking. Meaning you can slowly ease yourself into the fantastic depth that Football Manger provides for club management. Whilst if you are a returning player, the improvements to aspects like the match engine and the development centre should allow a greater sense of success in the short term while allowing the ability to feel like you have left a legacy with a club in the long term.Many people may be put off with Football Managers limited licenses in comparison to games like FIFA, with the lack of Premier League licenses, with the exception of Watford, potentially disinteresting a core English audience. Although that being said, the use of the EFL and National League licenses within the game should encourage more lower league management, which in my opinion, provides a much more enjoyable experience than starting your saves at already financially secure and successful teams. Moreover, the complications surrounding the German national team and the Brazilian Leagues can also detract from your experience. However, the ability to install a wide range of graphical and database improvements provided by the fantastic Football Manager community can resolve such issues, these improvements may not be directly supported by Sports Interactive due to legality issues, again surrounding licenses, yet they are perfectly easy to install on the PC version of Football Manager (Simply Google how to install Facepacks, Club Badges, Name Fixes, Entire new divisions, etc).Football Manager cannot be learnt to play in a day, as much as that may differ certain players, its simply the reality of this game. Football Manager provides a incredible depth to club managements and players will be learning certain mechanics and nuances to the games up to years after playing it. I, myself still learn small things about the game after playing games in the franchise for 4 years now. Yet, If you are willing to brave the seemingly steep learning curve at first glance and learn the core mechanics to this game, I strongly believe you will find yourself hooked into crafting your own narrative and stories through this digital football world."
1100600,3,0,7.65612E+16,63,2,-1,853.9,"21 April, 2020","As someone who has bought pretty much every year's instalment of Football Manager for the last 10 years running, I have to say this one is a massive disappointment.The match engine is absolutely abysmal, and simply provides absolutely no reward for creating a good tactic and carving the opposition open as your players will miss one-on-ones and clear cut chances over and over again, irrespective of how good they are supposed to be as a finisher. You will repeatedly find that the game punishes you for playing football, and instead rewards tactics that only focus on Pulis-style hammering of crosses and long balls into the box and set pieces. It is just so horribly demoralising to see your team achieve great stats, dominate possession, shots and clear cut chances, only to watch highlight after highlight of your top strikers repeatedly missing ridiculously simple chances.I would strongly advice you to avoid this game at all costs and simply play an older version of Football Manager where the engine actually works to reward effective tactics and doesn't leave you pulling your hair out when your key striker, a player who on my save was ridiculously overpowered in terms of his attributes for his level, misses 95% of one-on-ones, spurning 6 clear cut chances only for the opposition to score two headers from corners and win.Horribly unrewarding, do not play."

Wide players will attempt to score from the byline several times each game instead of passing to an unmarked striker. There are almost no forward passes centrally and no through balls at all, so most goals are the result of a winger, inside forward or overlapping back crossing to the other side of the box where an onrushing winger will score. Or a set piece which seems overpowered to compensate for the relative lack of goals from open play.Occasionally a midfielder will score a screamer from 30 yards from a cut back but strikers score mostly rebounds and headers from set pieces and get very little service in normal play.It's very possible to win most your matches by having world-class inside forwards but I finally got fed up with every attack looking the same."

When it comes to tactics, and managing the team it is realistic and even when you are in a match you can edit and adjust accordingly to whoever you are playing against. However, I believe the way players play on the pitch is quite vexing since they do idiotic movements that are not fitting - for an example, your player is right in front of the goal and instead of scoring the goal they decide instead to shoot it at the goal keeper. Realism for being a manager and pulling the tactics etc, I give it a 9/10Player realism on the pitch? 5/10Graphics and the likes, player icons etc. 3/10"

I am astounded at how incredible this game is and I am disappointed in myself I didn't switch to this years ago. The detail put in to this game is incredible. If you're a true football fan to put it quite lightly, you will adore this game. At first I had a look at the menu I was handed and I'll be honest, I was confused. Never been more confused in my life. Gradually as I went on I learned more and more things and even now I'm still learning. I've only played so many hours (due to my low attention span I really can't just play the same game for hours and hours on end).I can understand why when the matches actually take place the graphics aren't too great but it seems we've become lost where graphics are actually better than the rest of the game. I'd take Football Manager having the fantastic opportunities and detail given to me opposed to nice graphics for a 10 minute interval where I don't even have control directly over my players. It simply doesn't bother me and it shouldn't bother you. A million percent there could be improvement in graphics but it really shouldn't matter.Personally, I bought this on sale for around Â£20 and if I'm being honest I feel like that was the right price for me to pay for this game. I'd advise to buy it on sale especially now considering FM21 is coming out soon which I will be honest I probably won't buy until it goes on sale. That's just me though, trying to save some money and feeling when the time is right.If you're a massive football fan who loves and is intrigued with the game additionally love the tactical and managerial side, this game is for you. Don't think it's easy and you'll understand everything straight away otherwise you will not have a fun time!"

At all levels and situations - making a change in seems to yield rather random results, FM19 seemed to have a better balance of cause and  effect.- Zebre FC (although i understand why)-  I think too many chances per game, although i haven't studied the statistics compared to reality-  seems impossible to 'tighten up' or try and maintain possession. -  I'm not overly bothered about match day graphics, as i like 2D Traditional (top down) view. - Alot of aimless punts up the pitch/bad computer AI. - Teams seem incapable of moving up the pitch as a unit. - Lots of stuff appears to happen in the last 10 mins- Not totally sure all the pre-set style of tactics are necessary.Anyway - usually a huge fan of this game and left frustrated with this version of it. I see others are having similar issues and  i think these have been acknowledged."

The in-game mechanics and engine have been improved immensely. The AI now develops better tactics and squad building which punish the player that doesn't critic his tactics and mange his own squad and makes each match even more intense, keeping you on the edge of your seat until the final whistle. Great work by the team over SI and I look forward to playing this franchise for many years to come."

1100600,7,0,consciousbutsleepy,438,41,-1,159.8,"2 April, 2020","Having played all editions since like 2005, I can say that I finally reached a point where I had enough with this game. It's decent as all the games from the series are, it's undeniable that for all of us football fans there's always a smile to be attained every year when we take our team to the glory and that alone keeps making us play it with a smile everyday. But I think it's time for me to just say, I had enough with buying it for full price and it being exactly the same thing, over, and over, and over again, and guess what, the problems that it always had are still there and I don't think SE will ever fix them.The game's randomness is it's main problem, it's inconsistent as hell as it's always been and it can become frustrating to a point where you just don't feel like wasting time on it anymore. A good example of this randomness is with injuries, god awful, it doesn't happen in a football team for in less than a month 10 players or more of your team getting injured even when you made sure you have the best physios and conditions in the club. It also doesn't happen your striker with amazing attributes failing 10-20 goals per match, it also seldomly happens that your same striker fails to pass the ball to a colleague that is alone 10 cms on the side and can easily score. Also, players are human beings, and as any conscious human being, you cannot expect a poor team to reinforce your squad with millions when they are not available, but in this game, every single player will create drama for every little thing, and it becomes TERRIBLY annoying at some point. We know now that we live in an era where football players cost a lot of money, but man, after 5-6 seasons, even the lowest of players cost over 5-10 millions and it just becomes impossible for you to deal in any sorts with other teams. Also I doubt that any big team would be able to spend over 600 million every year like I see in this game happening... Another propper example of failure in this game is what happened to me this season, I won a game 4-0 on my first go and I was playing with a team that was inferior to it's adversaries, but not by much, and my PC crashed after. Reloaded the game, and for my surprise I couldn't win that game afterwards anymore for some reason, even though I changed absolutely nothing, now, I normally don't replay games (if I lose I lose, just like in real life, there's always a chance of that happening since everyone has a bad day) but I replayed this game about 10 times and I never won it again. So if that isn't randomness, than what is it? Football doesn't work like that my dudes, of course there's always a chance for any team as long as it's 22 men on the pitch fighting it out, but it puzzles me on how stupid it can be sometimes. I think this algorythm that the game uses, is in no way perfect, but damn, it should've been perfected in 20 years no? It's the least you could do for people that keep cashing in every year.These same mistakes, of course, arguably, are what set this in being a game and not real life, but when you play a game like this for being a simulation, it should be as accurate to the real thing as it can get, and it puzzles me that in 20 years these dudes have not improved one single bit. Now you can come and argue with the ""UI has changed, better scouting etc."" sure thing, but is it really any way superior year after year? Not really, it is just a different shade of paint on the same painting every year. Cannot in any way recommend this game to anyone, even though I have fun with it as I do every year, and as probably I will keep playing it every year, guilty pleasure I guess or the love of football, or maybe both. But it's getting harder and harder to recommend this to anyone, when it's not a football simulator anymore, it's a randomness simulator with football elements."

It is both limited and repetitive; the lack of variation in highlights, goals and overall play is a let down. If you want to rely on set piece goals to win, you're in luck. There are some great aspects - player development, training, transfers, club philosophy, tactical set up - these have been very well implemented. BUT, following all the clicks, drags and efforts to make things the way you want, the match engine takes one giant safety pin to the balloon that is FM's enjoyment.The ME has never been perfect, or even 'great' in my view, but it has at least in most versions represented your football in such a way you see balance in reward alongside punishment.

If Sports Interactive were interested in making a good game, they'd release FM once every 2 years and actually take time to improve things. I've been playing since FM12 and even then people were complaining about the match engine. Disappointing that every edition still has a glaring bug when it comes to gameplay (players not squaring the ball, one-on-ones). And each new FM seems more focused on feature-creep crap like player interactions and adding unnecessary jobs like data analyst and sports scientist. Why are my players always talking to me when the conversation options feel like they're written by someone who has never spoken to people? Why add data analysts when your scouts keep recommending you Mbappe, Aguero and Varane even though you're managing Norwich? FM is getting more bloated with each year and these features have been gradually eroding away at the actual fun of the series. I want to develop unknown youngsters into star players and I want to devise tactics that allow my team to play beautiful football. I don't want to get into an argument with my 18-year-old striker about why I played him as an Advanced Forward instead of a Poacher like I promised. I can understand the realism behind a prima-donna millionaire footballer throwing a  fit but if practically every player in my Vanarama National league team is a ticking time bomb then this game is just nonsensical.$50 for a transfer update and new ways to piss your players off is daylight robbery."

This game is so unrealistic.In all seriousness though, the match engine is a disaster-class. Bang average at best players employ their 10-11 dribbling skill to run past 3 world class defenders on the regular.You get 1-2 goals disallowed and 3-4 shots hitting the post literally every game. Mediocre goalkeepers manage to parry 15-20 shots per game while their equally mediocre forward teammates convert 2 out of 3.15+ marking defenders make it a point to leave opposing players completely alone, instead marking their own teammates.Defenders pull off sliding tackles on their own teammates in their own box, but absolutely refuse to attempt tackles on opponents advancing towards their goal.And speaking of sliding tackles, on the off-chance someone actually performs one on an opponent, the ball only moves about 5 cm so the tackled player shrugs, picks it up again and continues his run. That's not how physics work, SI!This game actually makes me miss FIFA manager..."

There have been some high water mark moments and some low points along the way - I've also find it hard to justify spending full game price on a game that for all intents and purposes introduces minor tweaks at best.I have long lamented the addition of social media and press conferences into the game and managing a world of pre-madonnas isn't exactly my idea of fun but the game has improved greatly in what you can strip out and give to other people to do in-game. Even if they sometimes drop the ball and you have to bail them out!That said, the game play and quality therein has returned with this iteration - I can honestly say FM20 is going to keep me entertained for a long while yet!"

Where the new games fixes bugs and player transfers. Here the game knows that players can easily do so the new transfer window matches with the prior game. But in general this game have a much better match system than the prior version, it feels more realistic with movements and positions. The game made it more fun to look at the social media section, with more fan comments on your success or failure as a manager.

It's great for the money men, it's great for Sega, but something has changed with Sports Interactive (SI) with this game. The match engine is an abomination this time around and SI have done little to fix it and Neil Brock has basically dismissed the torrent of negative feedback on the official forum saying that SI are happy with with the match engine. He basically said they don't care about the fans that have helped shaped the game series over the past 25-30 years. This is worrying, it is so broken and unbalanced this time around for a senior figure at SI to think this and communicate this with their most diehard fans clearly shows that the drive of improving fundemental features is gone and that the objective it to fluff the game out with nice sounding but useless features to boost the annual marketing push.I'm so disappointed in this iteration of the series and in my opinion it is the worst Football Manager in many years. The game is jut not fun to play, even with success. There is no way as a Football Manager player of 25 years that I can recommend this game. Football Manager 2021 will be the first game in over 20 years that I do not buy at launch.New comers to the series you will probably enjoy the game as it will be your first and you will likely be drawn in by the depth and all the things that has made the game great for so many years. But extended play will lay bare the awful match engine which will never be fixed.NOT RECOMMENDEDSource: Neil Brock post on official SI forums: https://community.sigames.com/topic/514560-football-manager-2020-january-february-transfer-updates-feedback-thread/?do=findComment&comment=12305407Example of issues with the match engine - number of missed one on ones, the number 10 role being useless and bypassed, too many goals from long shots, awful crossing, ineffective central play making all games feel the same, world class strikers scoring paltry amounts of goals, set pieces and long shots being the main source of goals and many many more (I suggest looking at the thread linked above to see in depth the fundemental and immersion destroying flaws)"

The interminable injury time with the inevitable 94th minute winner.Liverpool and their team of supermen. I paused the game and they had all 10 of their outfield players in my half in open play. I can never get my CB's to go beyond the half way line other than set pieces. I go from from very defensive to very attacking and everything in between. I've replayed the same game 100 times. Can't even get a draw. Law of averages says I should get a least 1 draw surely.The ability of the AI sides to use pull backs, pass and move. All things my players never do no matter how much I tinker with them. I would really like the option of not having to play the match and just let the AI decide the outcome. My suspicion is i would get more wins.If you want a game that is no fun at all but piles on the frustration this is the game for you. Yet the worst part. It's like a drug. You can't stop playing.

Game also chronically overuses VAR, simply because its a novel, shiny new toy. In game VAR decisions always arrive at the same outcome! ( *spoiler alert* if VAR is checking to see if an offence happened in or outside the box, then it always decides it happened outside! Oh, and it always gives the penalty!)

But, I can't stop playing FM20 for the life of me. Its your standard FM game, but this year your strikers barely score. So being creative with your tactic is more viable to enjoying good results on the field. This is even after the January update!Should you buy FM20, yes! I give it a solid 9 out of 10! My only gripe with the game itself is the countless problems its had with launch bugs since release. That, and I have it installed on 2 computers.....same specs just different graphics cards. Each install has the same mods on it, yet only my gtx1660ti runs the game.

It was released on 19 November 2019. In this review, I will briefly cover Football Manager game play, run through the features introduced in FM20 and provide a perspective on the state of the game.In FM20, you, the player, manage a football team through 118 playable leagues. Of this 118, 26 leagues in 14 countries are fully licensed and another 24 teams (national and domestic teams) are licensed. Within the 26 leagues: French Ligue 1 and Ligue 2, German leagues one to three, and English leagues two to four are fully licensed. The English Premier League, Spanish La Liga, and Italian leagues are not; though the Serie A has 18 of 20 licensed teams.  Game Mechanics / FM20 Features  Football Manager incorporates a variety of features and mechanics; including, but not limited to, 2D and 3D football matches, squad training, scouting and transfers, tactics, and financial management. The series also includes a vibrant modding community. In FM20, SI various smaller features such as Club Vision - long-term club progression, the introduction of the Development Centre, transfer negotiation improvements, better integration of backroom staff into your operations, and match engine and graphic upgrades.I reflect on these main marketed features as small, but solid quality of life features that has a ton of room for improvement in future iterations. Club Vision enables you to consider the long-term aspect of the game, however I found that negotiating a different vision is not user-friendly to do and the Board of Directors offers you little flexibility to amend their vision. Further, Club Vision allows for player negotiations to be interesting by offering players different playing times, but a mechanic that SI should balance because the penalty for not adhering to the playing time is little.More on FM20's features: The Development Centre is a cool feature that consolidates your developmental squads into a single UI. This is a neat addition because you can treat your reserve squads similarly, and staff provide useful contextual advice to you on the progression of players. The changes to backroom staff are visible, i.e. you can select Technical Directors and Loan Managers, but I have yet to see any observations in their role. Lastly, the match engine and graphic upgrades are nice, but the match engine has a lot of room for improvement. If I summarise FM20 by the above features is relevant, yet underwhelming, but nice inclusions to expand on the core game mechanics.  Perspective on Annual Releases  I have played Football Manager since Football Manager 2017. Across these four iterations, I recall that only two of the four (2017 and 2019) made substantial changes to the game. It appears that SI Games has a formula which Year X incorporates large changes and Year Y focusses on quality of life improvements that expand or address concerns on features from Year X.Â I acknowledge the concerns of the community and question the situation: Is SI Games complacent? I think the football management market has a lack of competition and variety. While SI Games makes enjoyable annual games, I think they could address more community concerns, particularly with the match engine and to fix the various glitches and bugs throughout the game. I do appreciate that SI Games is expanding the licensing of official teams and leagues because it makes playing the game a more enjoyable experience. But in saying that, I vastly enjoy the Football Manager series and it is addictive; though sometimes a frustrating experience.  Conclusion  FM20 is an ultimately enjoyable game. It benefits from having a strong foundation of team management and football simulation, at the consequence of visible stagnation to new features and post-launch support. FM20 specifically, has some nice features, but I applaud more the many quality of life changes implemented by SI Games. If you are new to Football Manager, I recommend FM20 at full price. If you own FM19, I recommend the game on sale.  Rating  7.5/10  Pros  * Core mechanics are immensely fun, including team and financial management, and social feeds* Development Centre is interesting and useful* Modest match engine and graphical improvements, including upgrades to manager appearances* Slightly improved press conferences and tunnel interviews; your manual comments can slightly benefit or hinder player morale.  Cons  * Series has a need for material improvement including: more animations and enhancing the fluidity of matches, more applicable feedback from players and staff, press conferences, and financial management such as customising and managing club facilities and managing tickets/negotiating sponsorship deals* Underwhelming Club Vision and player negotiation features* Inability to identify applicability of new backroom staff and the supposed improvements to staff.If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

It's simple not realistic (nor fun) having 20 shots and not score once, while the AI has nearly 100% accuracy. You can literally lose a plethora of games just because the other team had 1 chance during the game! So, all those hours spent recruiting players, setting up tactics, pieces, researching, even watching YT videos...are worthless. The AI can win even it just had 1 GK and 1 Striker player vs 11.

Result? 1-0. with 3 highlights the entire game. Usual stats - 60+% possession, 25+ shots, 0 goals. No matter the formation/squad.Seriously Devs, take a year out, and actually produce something new that makes it special again.

One of the striking disappointments is the SAME media questions being recycled for the 5th year running, which makes the whole thing feel monotonous. Symbolic, really, of how the franchise has lost its beating heart. The game is no longer fun anymore with so much crammed onto the screen (for stats sake) the eyes are overwhelmed by text and numbers on skins that are cheap and garish. The 3d match engine gets worse with each iteration, and 2020's effort resembles a 6th formers animation project, with players gliding surreally gliding around the pitch loosely coinciding with ball movement. Goal replays are dampened as the ball crashes into the net and the spectators remain seated, and then... oh, they're up and celebrating a little while after. The training screen is so busy now, it just makes you want to ignore this aspect of the game because its simply to onerous to manage or understand how on earth any of it will impact upon your team. The Player Search list is now cumbersome with each player listing now 2-3 rows in width which prolongs the process of browsing for players. Since 2017, the joy has simply been sucked out of these games by a developer who seems intent on ripping out everything that was good about the game and replacing it with ridiculously packed screens of mostly inconsequential data. Sega/SI would be better off building a baseline game based on some of the better versions, and simply keep it updated. They'll still be quids in. The constant unnecessary tweaks to the game are killing it."

Goalkeepers have gone back to previous games of being redundant (one of the things I liked about this game was that goalkeepers actually made saves, sometimes even when one on one, now they are beaten every time) defending is poor and the whole premise is just who scores the most goals in the game (I know that's how you win games but winning games 5-4, 6-3, 4-3 isn't a good thing, especially as both teams hit the post so often despite how many goals are scored) I've tried different tactics and different teams to see if there are ways to not concede so many goals but there isn't, so just set out an attacking formation and hope you score more than your opponent, the whole thing is luck based now,  if your players are on form that day, you win, if not, you lose heavily and your teams morale is ruined. Such a shame as I would have heavily recommended this game before the update ruined the match engine, It's not a management game anymore, it's just a luck based simulator"

1100600,0,0,7.65612E+16,36,1,-1,248.6,"16 February, 2020","There's several issues with this game, a major one is deletion of ALL your player instructions for set pieces if you switch between tactics, the right players will no longer be taking the right positions, the game swaps them all and jumbles them up. Apart from this bug however there are gaping wholes throughout all the game engine, there is essentially no such thing as defending. You can easily conceded a hundred goals a month. The game only recognises attack as a strategy and if you attack correctly you automatically defend, examples including Watford wingbacks on defend against you dribbling past 5 players 90 yards up the pitch cutting inside when they are right footed only and scoring a 30 yard screamer with a long shot rating of 4 and finishing of 6. Expect Raheem Sterling to man mark your players like a good and track back despite pep laying down a high pressing tactic rather than marking. Expect totally phantom tactics regardless of scouting reports such as the opposition defending narrow and man marking when slated for a high line press, you can either press or you can man mark, it also doesn't seem to make any difference what the attributes of the players are the computer can simply play the best tactics against you and their players will fill their roles perfeclty and have perfect squad harmony and passing teamwork no matter having never played that formation against you all season. Whatever you do the entire league will set up specifically to counter just your team including buying players that you need such as inside forwards. The whole game rather than being a challenge seems to be arbitarily cheating against the human player with the entire tactics and game engine and scouting essentially being meaningless, including if you change tactics to spring a surprise the day before the computer will just play with a totally different formation to the one scouted!"

After 2 very successful years with the confidence of the board being over 90%, I cannot play it anymore. The board is blocking my transfers cause they want me to sign more players from a specific country outside the EU. I already signed one last year who is now one of their top national team performers, I signed 3 promising youths who will be joining next year, they still block all my attempts to really strengthen the squad. I do not know how this is supposed to work... I do not know if the devs have understood how this works in reality but what they have implemented is totally crappy and a game stopper. Fun fact is that the specific team I am playing used to have two players from that country and now has none... Another issue I dealt with was the fact that the board was aiming at building a new stadium but when they agreed to upgrade the youth facilities this particular goal just disappeared and suddenly, even expanding the stadium was not deemed financially viable... Both these problems seriously affect my game and enjoyment and are by no means realistic.Apart from that, I do not really understand how they can do that, but every year the game feels slower than last year. The match engine is not bad, but still far from being visually up to date, days drag by.. slowly... scouting feels much clunkier, training could use some automations and so on.In all, I do sadly not consider FM2020 as a successful upgrade, I enjoyed FM2018 much more."

Even though the game does seem to take considerable longer to play than other versions. Once you put the ground work into your club the game becomes more enjoyable. One part of the game i quite like is how players can improve and their ability isn't set in stone.

Amount of times you out-shot the opponent 33-2 and the game is 1-1 on a last minute tie goal is maddening. Do these type so games happen in real life...yes...but, that does not happen 10-15 times in a season to the same team...that might happen once every 5-10 years to a team.

Now you have to deal with so much asking from the board. The way how the staffs really involved in your game and development center also was the good from this year' version. But like other review before me has said, compared to FM19 the things I mentioned before was just ""small"" upgrade. The rest? Still the same. Match engine still has its routine bug. So it kinda like you bought FM19 + really minor patch. Overall, I still recommend this game to the old player and the new one who has not decided yet to buy the game after around two months since its release. Good job SI! You earned my money (again)!"

1100600,18,0,7.65612E+16,42,1,-1,195.1,"6 February, 2020","So, I have played Football Manager for about twenty years, since the days it was still Championship Manager, back in 2000.The game always had this random component to some aspects but it was fun once you got the hold of it and had your team playing in a consistent way. That is until this year.It seems like the game is set to screw you most of the time. Really.While this is not really something new to the avid Football Manager player, as most of us have experienced a sense of unfairness, at some point, in the game; on this version, you get it most if not all of the time.Mind you that I am an experienced player and I have won, over the years that I have played the game, everything that there is to win and on different clubs.On this year's version, despite winning the league on the first season and having a world class team, after three seasons, I couldn't even be a contender for the Champion's League qualification places. I had some of the best players in the game, like Tonali, Havertz, Ansu Fati, Sancho, Bernardo Silva. I had a dream team, really and I would struggle to beat weak teams. Constantly.I tried multiple tactics, nothing really worked in a long therm. The tactic that won me the league, on the first year, suddenly stopped working even tho my team was actually stronger. I mean, you don't change something that is working and is consistent. Such is the philosophy that allowed me and, likely, most of the players in the game to achieve success, eventually. Even if there were some struggles at the beginning.I tried to have more than one tactic and get my team familiar with those, so I could change if something was not working, I tried multiple approaches with training and team mentality, player instructions and, as stated, even with some of the best signings in the game, it wouldn't matter. AI would score goals, constantly, after being outplayed for the entire match. And yes, I know this happens in real life but it doesn't happens as often as in this game. It's stupid and unrealistic.Maybe, for people who are really dedicated to the game, spend hours planning and reading every detail on the tactics and have a vast knowledge, these issues can be worked on but it's not really a game for the player who just wants to chill, keep things relatively simply and have some fun with their favourite team because, even the experienced player, might get screwed. The game can, indeed, be very gratifying when you win something, specially in the last games of the season, when everything is really close but, believe me, most of the time, it is incredibly frustrating. The possible reward by winning something, even with a top team, is not worth the annoyance and the sensation of wasted time and confusion as to why the AI still manages to beat you against all odds, more often than not.I don't know what SI is doing but it seems like their attempt to make the game realistic has set them on a path where things are out of control, most of the time and you are always on the edge of your seat, on every game, regardless if you're playing against the strongest contender of the competition or a club that is just playing to avoid relegation. You never know if you're going to win, no matter how strong your team is.It is pretty much what some people have been saying here, lately. You will also find many posts on Reddit about this.No matter what you do, it won't make a difference and it is, probably, a bug from some recent update.I liked the previous versions, on past years but I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Save your money, your time and, especially, your sanity."

It almost reminds you of FIFA or PES ten years ago when you can send through balls and 1-on-1 just by a click except your strikers (admittedly sometimes theirs) miss them in every way imaginable. That and many other disgusting plays you wouldn't see even once in a year irl...I mean in previous FMs you feel like the game likes to screw you up once in a while but you understand it happens after a bit of anger. This FM2020? You feel like nothing makes sense and you constantly ask yourself what the â™¥â™¥â™¥ is wrong with the players.Can't even count how many CM/FMs I've played and this is the first time I feel like a comment is needed.

(Feb 2020)FM20 was good when released, but a patch december 3rd. contained a bug cluster preventing open play goals. Because of this, what you do as a manager have very little to no impact on what happen on the pitch. Strangly alot of people enjoy this since they can create almost any tactic and pretend they are tactical genious, since they all work about the same in all situations.The Feb patch made som marginal improvment, but not nearly enough to fix the main issues.If you have an older FM game I advice sticking to that for now, if you are ok with just buying the best players and win without the tactical or strategic part of the game I think you still enjoy it,"

World class strikers almost always miss 1-on-1s. Defenders are horrible at positioning, and let strikers get 1-on-1s all the time - but it doesn't matter, because the strikers surely miss. There is zero reason to play in a counterattacking style in this game. Everyone in the goal area (defenders and attackers alike) look like Bambi on ice, and goalkeepers and defenders look tremendously stupid when they try to clear the ball, but accidentally shoot it into their own net. I like most aspects of this game *outside* of the matches, especially the people management aspects. But the good parts are completely overshadowed by the bad parts.

They tinkered with the match engine and it is now an unreliable joke of a simulator with, among other things, an unrealistically high number of one-on-one opportunities.  In poor fashion, they reacted to this by making strikers terrible at finishing the said one-on-ones off. This is absolute bull. (estimate average of about maybe 5-8 a game, often with NONE of them finished off)I got the game a while back, and refunded it after a day or so. I got it a second time against my better judgment and am here writing this after finishing 1 and a 1/2 seasons proper of the game to properly conclude that this game is absolute garbage.

I swore I was done buying the game but relented after 6 years and bought FM 2020. What a mistake. The match engine for fm2020 is even worse than in 2014, how is that even possible? Only one of the many tactical styles of play will ever get you results. You can spend hours setting team and individual tactics just to watch the game show your team following none of them. Constant direct long balls when playing possession build up is a joke, full backs scoring blinders every game while strikers can never convert the way too many 1v1 chances magically created. Defenders that do not play a covering role even when set to with a low defensive line are constantly going high just to then get beaten by a long ball to the striker in behind. It is clear the match engine is not an actual real-life game in motion, but pre-defined scripted plays that you have no control over, nor do your tactics.This game is sold as being as close to real life as a football management game can be, funny how in real life I don't see every team playing route 1 long balls or the gegenpress across the world.

Tactics matter very little and there's very little diversity to what you can play with any element of success. The opposition get in behind every five minutes and no tactical changes nullify it, yet your players will miss one on ones every single time. Strikers getting 6.4s or lower every game is abject, seemingly for no reason, as they get chances, but can't put away routine finishes, despite having 18-19 finishing. And if you miraculously hold out against the one on one over the top ball nonsense, the opposition will score a screamer against you. This season, 10 games in and I've seen such renowned long shot specialists as Kyle Walker, Joe Gomes, Abdoulaye Doucoure and Stefano Sensi score thunderbastards into the top corner. Yet Harry Kane can't score from 5 yards with just the keeper to beat. But at the end of the day, buy the game and play it how you want. But when Danny Welbeck and Adam Lallana score a hat-trick against you, you'll be very, very sorry."

They never change the game and update it as good as they can each year because they want to save some new features for the following year to get more money... Why support this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ company.The match engine is broken, they tried to fool us with a new match engine BETA which is still â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.- Defenders keep avoiding the strikers when they come into the penalty box. They litteraly avoid them, its like they are scared of the strikers.- Attackers miss every â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ opportunity given, crosses, 1 vs 1, they miss everything.- You can have 60% of posession and shoot 30 TIMES, that the opposite team will shoot 4 times and they will win.I had several games in the lower leagues of english football where I was winning 2-0, 3-0, even 4-0 with 15 shots or more and they have 6 shots and score them all. I have tried changing formations, every tactic out there... Nothing, even on the BETA.

It was called a bit different back then, posing the -title- winning Championship Manager crown. An era where you just read text about your imaginary joga bonito and had some sheer fun cheering at flashing psychedelic text.Those days are long gone. From Championship, we have switched to just... Football. Do not get me wrong, I'm not another one of those nostalgicphiles, quite the opposite. However, it just incomprehensible that the game is going from bad to worse. DLC level additions year after year, and an ever declining match engine that has just led to today's broken game. We never asked our addiction to follow RTX tech level advancements. All we asked -and to this day, still do- is that what you try to 'design' on a tactics board, is followed to a logical extent on the pitch. Instead of aiming to fix the ice skating phenomena of the motion -wtf is- captured, focus on getting the basics right. The game should all be AI, seamlessly working algorithms, multi million calculations per second that would resurrect ENIAC out of its grave. I fail to comprehend how the match engine is declining instead of improving over the past few months/years. With all due respect to those hard working individuals (I'm sure there's plenty of those) but is the level of staff working in SI declining? From a CX perspective, you consistently present a malfunctioning product, with DLC level additions, at a premium Epsilon Alpha (wink wink) price. Hand in heart, you should take a sabbatical year from production, fix the basics of a functional match engine, and release the next version on September 1st 2021. Yep, the year is not a typo. Riding that early season hype wave may even help you recover the lost year of revenue. I just came across a post from 2010 where a player was complaining about a 3% cross completion ratio. Guess what, a decade later, players with crossing 15+ finish the game with 10-15%. Your team's players crosses will always be stopped by those heroic opposition fullbacks, despite having galloped past them like Usain Bolt against schoolboys. On the opposite end of the pitch, those schoolboys always get their revenge with a staggering 80%+ cross completion ratio! Goal conversion is just like VAR in England. An absolute joke. One-on-ones are still not fixed since...October XX (where XX add the year of your liking). Lukaku level strikers (love or hate), finish two seasons with 8% conversion. Lautaro loves bruising the shins of centre halves by fiercely kicking the s*** out of them (with the ball, no red card material here you naughty minds).Goalkeeper distribution is still as good as CM 00/01. Imaginary. ""Ederson with the quick release"" remains fiction.Anyway, I could go on and on and on... But truth is, I'm tired. Tired like you start a Champions League final in June with 58% condition... The match engine is just like a hamstring. They think it's healthy and gets torn again. Don't force us to retire, get us a good head of sports science to restore our faith in the parallel universe that we all loved over the years..."

You'll get a chance to re-build, manage your beloved club and maybe lead the club to glory!

I've been a big FM fan for a long time now but this game is beyond frustrating. Like all other reviewers have said, match engine has completely ruined the game for me. Countless 1v1s are missed (these are with some of the best forwards in the game, mind you). Any defender is able to play a perfect long ball over the top while my entire back line are spectators. Wingers constantly cut inside and smash it into the side netting--all just incredibly frustrating! Will be sticking to FM19 until these issues are fixed, this game is honestly unplayable at the moment."

I breathe and speak football 24/7Â and it has always been a distant dream of mine to become a professional manager at some point.  As that dream is a little unrealistic, FM has always been a good replacement. I have been playing this game since 2014 and has since then played every edition of the game for more hours than i probably should. But the game is just too good. Not only incredibly fun, but also the most realistic football game on the market and the fact that SEGA and everyone participating in making this game manages to improve it every year and for every edition they release is simply incredible!

1100600,78,1,gibbsi,99,3,-1,118.3,"13 January, 2020","First review I've ever left, but feel I need to add a warning here. As of 13 January 2020, the match engine is fundamentally broken - one on ones and headers are almost impossible to score regardless of the level. You'll spend hours trying to figure out a way to convert chances, thinking it's your tactic that's the problem, but the match engine so far this year is just bugged. Look on reddit etc and you'll see hundreds of posts with the same issue.My advice is to not buy this game until they've fixed it - it's a joke that it still hasn't been addressed by now and SI is another company who are happy to release an unfinished, untested product and screw over their loyal customers. They hardly make any changes every year - so why they can't devote more time to QA before release is just negligent. FM has become a cash cow to SEGA in much the same way FIFA is for EA.Notice how you can no longer buy any of the previous years editions of FM which are balanced and just require an updated database to bring up to date. SI and Sega are pulling a fast one.Recommendation: Buy the game in March or April when it's fixed and is 50% of the price.Pros:Dev Center.New analysis tools.New staff roles.Cons: Broken & Unrealistic Match Engine.Very few changes notable from last year."

The AI is basically idiots and plays like a new comer. The game isn't that exciting when you have to go against a PL or Real or Barca rosters. One of my saves City has all there key players and also add Dybala, Joao Felix, Federico Chiesa, Neves, Declan Rice, Bentancur, Esposito for those who don't know this guy is OP in saves. and Mohamed Ihattaern. And many more top tier players the problem with this? Is its unrealistic the AI commonly does this and stack up with all there top players. And If your a smaller club they can raid your club for key players by tossing there weight around. and their whole roster is filled with overpaid players that no way they can get away with if the AI operates with FFP. But teams that splurge like this City are common United raided be for Dembele spent 109 million on him doesn't start him and he plays no games for them. Transfer list him a year later for 70 million? why did they spend that 100+ million with no attention of using him it makes no sense. this has happen multiple times and in every save I have done with small clubs. Keep this in mind City built that roster 3 years in its insane how stacked teams get. Another problem are AI clubs not selling players which can get dumb. I offered 20 mill for Kepa ""That's his price in the game""  and Chelsea was refusing why you ask? IDK because they had Oblak starting so why would Chelsea hold on to a 10 mill a year back up GK. Is something you must ask the Devs themselves. Another issue I have ran into is injuries it seems only my team gets hit with them as hard. And when I say hard its like a punch from Wilder hard. Most of the players on your roster comes down with it. Which makes it so much harder to win crap cause not only are you factoring in your key players who play awful in game but also injuries. Every season I have played in this game at least 2 of my players go down with a 2 month + injury. Now to gameplay its not really all that much from what I feel. Many goals gain seem like stupidity and wouldn't happen in a real game. In a huge cup game my experienced players fold like a omelette. classic game sheets you will have in this game is 20 shots 11 on target AI stats 4 shots 1 on target. And this would resolute in a loss for you. I understand this happens in real life but clear dominance in game? And you are more likely tying or losing gets annoying. The game scripting ruins it hugely anyone who telling you they enjoyed this and its perfect is lying or a Bot. This game is riddle with glitches if you want actual real review go to the dicussion and the Discord the game sheets are memes now because its that bad. You can have a from 3 of Mbappe Ronaldo and Messi and they will all be pocketed by a MLS back line if the game in the mood for it. This game was made by a PL fan because they always win everything in my saves. All the saves are the same things same players are sold in all of them and same moves. and if you want to try and ""build young"" after 2 years they're all 100 million for 1 17 year old that hasnt played. But if you have a good young talent your getting offered 10 million. explain this game better if you new dont pick this up unless your willing to watch youtube videos or become tester. Cause the game doesnt teach you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and you will be lost and trash if you depend on the game."

The match engine is fundamentally broken - too easy to split a defence open with a long ball resulting in a one-on-one, so SI nerfed the conversion rates of one-on-one chances to keep scorelines acceptable. The result however, is that your world class  striker misses 2-5 easy chances every game. Wingers do not square the ball for strikers, instead preferring to shoot from obscenely acute angles rather than play the ball across the box. Half the crowd is a repeated man in an orange jumper. This may sound minor but it's really immersion breaking once you notice it. You can be a team that plays in blue, and yet over 50% of the crowd are dressed in orange. It diminishes the match experience and detracts from the game as a whole.It's crap like this, broken for 2 months now, I've bought every game in this series since the year 2000, I pre-order every year (literally the only game I will do so with) and said I'll continue to do so until I get burned. Well, SI Games, you've broken me at last. The 'Bugs' section of your forum is littered with these issues that are ""under review"", well you can consider my purchase of FM 2021 in the same category.Edit: I played a bunch more because apparently I'm a masochist. The match engine is total cack and has regressed massively since FM 2017. Don't waste your money - take up a more enjoyable pastime such as jamming needles in your eyes, you'll thank me for it."

1100600,4,1,fatblu,382,5,-1,743.5,"5 January, 2020","Quite simply put, not worth full price because the match engine is absolutely pathetic. The players stats do not matter and every goal keeper is the best goal keeper in the world. Also no matter how highly rated your strikers are, they will fail to convert 95% of chances. I'd say, either wait for SI to fix this sad excuse of an engine which is surprisingly worse than FM19 or wait for the game to be on a very deep sale, probably 95% off.Update: Tried the latest beta patch, still the engine is broken. The players attributes are still not taken into consideration. Though 1v1 have reduced by around 90%, the strikers of your own team have completely forgotten how to play the game. The wingers have learned how to cross the ball and are more effective now. The defense how ever is still dumb struck over long balls over the head and overall haven't learned how to do their job, which is defending, instead they just turn around in circles and watch the opponents go past them. The cards have certainly reduced, but the foul count is still the same which is a lame way to fix an issue. The tactics and instructions are still a foreign language to the engine because it still calculates the winning chances based purely on the reputation of the club, which again is plain stupid. Advice to SI: Sack your current producer and don't release the next FM unless you fix the most important part of the game."

Sure. There are positives:Board Vision and the fact that clubs are now being picky over who they invite to interviews is both realistic and frustrating (lets be honest, how many Conference National managers get jobs at higher levels unless they get their team promoted - Christ.......even Grimsby just appointed Ian Holloway rather than take a risk on a proven manager such as Dodswell at Havant)Youth Development side of things is good and a real improvement as all fans want to see their clubs develop their youth players.Right........moan time: Firstly......I want to say that I have seen over 1500 football matches live (mainly PL and Championship but also many games in the Conference National and South) so in terms of having seen football I have about 150,000 hours of the damn game.MATCH ENGINE. Real ife vs FM20Real life:I took some notes from the last 10 live games I saw:Only  7 one on ones in ten games - 4 scored107 corners - 4 goals from themOnly twice did defenders get caught woefully out of position and outpaced by a strikerIn all ten games - NO goals from long shotsIn the FM20 match engine:About 10 one on ones a game - but with about a 10% conversion rate (if you're lucky) - too many one on ones by a long score but this is counteracted by the fact that no-one ever scores from them.Attackers whilst on the ball still easily outpace a retreating defender. This is utterly ridiculous as I've only ever seen top class players with rapid pace able to do this. Defenders never ""drop"". E.g. Even though a defender is 31 and had 300 games under his belt, he'll still allow a striker to run through the middle cos he's too busy marking someone else. Also, it doesn't matter what height defensive line you play as they'll always allow strikers to ghost past them for the inevitable missed one on one.Players just don't tackle. I mean. I play with a ""Get Stuck In"" mentality and even target some of their players further (yeah........nice I know) but the team waltz around the pitch like they're auditioning for Swan Lake.Shouts: Some work, some never work.......although there is probably more variation in what works from FM19. Concentrate and tighten up always cause utter confusion in the ranks even though you've justifiably given the instruction on 85 minutes when you're 2-1 up away from home. But they all get frustrated like they're six year olds who all want to score in a game down the park. Overall. I think a lot of the improvements to the ""glossy"" side of the game are good. But it does seem like SI have gone and done a Disney Star Wars......""Look......its so bright, flashy with all these special effects........its Football Manager - you've got to like it"". Even though the soul of the game has been completely ignored.Hoping this gets addressed in a patch but am worried that SI are now more interested in profit than caring for this game. Hoped to be proved wrong."

You need about 100 shots on target to score one goal, your strikers are totally unable to finish 1 on 1 even with 18+ in finishing and composure. This is so frustrating that you have to put commentary only so you do not have to watch your strikers squander every chances they have got. on the other hand, your fullback with 8 or less in long shots will score 10 goals from long shots. This is really the worst FM match engine in many years. I would love to get my money back!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!!!!! I have tried to play some more and ended up deleting the game from my computer. The media is still asking the same stupid questions, i would love for the stupid journalist to understand that i do not use AMC hence i am selling my AMC and that i need 3 CMs and therefore am looking for another one.

I have a a game in which i had 10 clear cut chances (the most i have ever seen) and won 1-0 what a joke...how is only one goal being scored.This is beyond my control as a manager i am delighted with the chances being created i can do no more and its agony watching chance after chance go by...what am i doing wrong????!Is anyone else expericing this?this is the first time i have not recommended a FM game i have given up unless there is something i can do to improve the scoring rate.

It's just a pointless tab- Don't know if anyone else gets this but you always end up drawing against the hardest team in a cup, Multiple times- Proof of scripting with drawing harder teams in cups and the occasional 3D match engine errors- The players themselves are just dumb and don't do what they are suppose to do accordingly for example booting the ball out when there is space. Shooting that goes miles off target. Not crossing the ball when there is a player unmarked and could potentially score- Every team no matter what even if play the instructions "" Pass into space "" Or short passing only "" They will still long balls over the defence or fail to vise versa. And quite a few goals have come through annoying over head long ballsThe only thing the game developers did to this game was improve the layout then brag about it like it was something refreshing when it really isn't.

I've had a ton more success after telling my team to shoot from long range all the time. How messed up is it that long range pot shots have a better rate of success than clear cut chances?Another issue is that strength and pace are still the be-all-end-all of attributes. There's no place in the game for intelligent players who don't rely on athleticism. For example, Firmino scored 3 goals in 15 games for me, but Origi who is only superior in the physical attributes is averaging a goal per game. Origi is playing like the world class forward Firmino should be just because he's fast and strong.I'm gonna shelve this for a while in the hopes that the match engine gets some serious patches."

After two updates and 3 seasons in the game, it's fair to say the problems really are in the match engine. This is my latest match report:TeamLiverpoolNorwichShots296Shots on Target132Possession54%46%Guess my final score? Liverpool (my team) lost 0-1 to Norwich. And this with me fielding Alisson, TAA, Ruben Dias, Van Dijk, F.Luis, Mane, Havertz, Sancho, Firmino etcProblems with ME that I notice:- One over the top through ball from your opponent and he's clean through, scoring his one-on-one chance.- Speaking of one-on-one chances, forget about it. You'll never score any. While your opponents score from just 1. - Don't even bother spending on forwards because they'll never score anyway. So I decided to spend on wingers, but they too just shoot into the side netting from ridiculous angles.- Dribbling is OP, my full-backs dribble all the way from their own halves, get into a very good crossing or cut-back position with an unmarked striker waiting in the box and guess what, they choose to shoot into the side netting.Not gonna play this frustrating game anymore.

On the contrary, my team (which has several world class players) struggle to put away 2 shots on very attacking mode when chasing a game in second half while opposition, on ultra defensive approach, is still able to have multiple attempts. Hitting woodwork, missing out on one-on-one with goalkeepers continuously and scoring unbelievable goals (from the top of head of defenders or 30 yard screamers) is as annoying as it gets. Becomes unplayable and boring after a point in time because change in tactics just doesnt yield anything and you are left with no choice but stop playing the game, Undoes all other upgrades made  in the game. would not recommend it to others till the time the developers come out with significant fixes to the match engine."

Top strikers cant score and miss a stupid amount of one on one chances. You will often find your team is 2 or 3 on 1 inside the 18 yard box and rather than square the ball for an easy goal your player will blast wide or straight at the keeper and there doesnt seem to be any defence against a long through ball which destroy you every time. I wont even go into how retarded the defending is on this years game but they literally run around in circles soumetimes.Dont bother buying it just stick to 19.

The bad results, the abysmal dressing room atmosphere, the unhappy players, the alleged refusal to sign new contracts. Your favorite football club is a huge, multi-billion euro organization, with players on yearly salaries that are enough to feed small towns. With all that cash coming in, you expect something. Especially if you pay for the Prem. You expect beautiful football, great goals, or even just good results half the time. Most football fans have the privilege of enjoying that on a consistent, week-to-week basis. But, as they say, ""You don't know what you've got, till you lose it."" One bad result turns to a win-less streak, one doubtful player turns to eleven, and in mere weeks, the rumors of sacking the manager start circulating. And who can blame the fans? They own the club. Their the ones who attend the game week in week out or watch it on telly like their fathers and grandfathers before them did. Not some Middle-Easterner looking to ""expand his horizons and make a quick buck."" But, before this turns into a rant about football hegemony, let me state my point. All those things; the pressure, the happiness of players, the expectations of the board, the inconsistent performances, you get to experience all of that in this game. Yes, you may not be able to do a Rabona kick or a half-volley from 30 yards or lead your bottom-table team to back-to-back Champions League wins in three seasons because you have it on Amateur. But most of the time, football's not about the glamour. Fin.If you're willing to invest time and effort in transforming your club into the powerhouse you wish it would be, then this is the game for you. It's wonderful and it can't be overstated how incredibly immersive this title is."

Despite that, this game series has to be the most baffling I've ever played--In like 15 years of playing videogames I have to say this is the only one that I seem to get worse at with time. Even after consuming a ton of online written/video guides I just can't seem to get a hang of it, so I suppose there is a possibility of user error here. There are a slew of numbers and an appearance of depth but it's extremely hard to me to see how you'd isolate out how one thing effects another...for example, did the changes in training actually help? Are slightly higher stats on my assistant manager actually doing anything? I could go on and on but you get my point. Also, as others have pointed out, the match engine seems super janky and random, and my team's excellent form would randomly crumble without any indication as to why.

If you manually select a player to play for the B team, the game does this unregistered check and don't allow the player to play, you have to use the broken menu, in the part that is supposed to be the already selected players to play and double tell that they can play, this apparently get around the unregistered problem. Unfortunately something prevents the selection inbox item from showing up most of the time, so it's really hard using the B team to get someone back after injury.England don't have B clubs, so at least I hope that is working better, but then we have a million other bugs, that has been reported year after year that SI just don't care about fixing.Then there is things like PSG is a better club than Barca and Real Madrid, so all the good players in the world want to play for PSG and PSG win bidding wars against the big clubs, but at the same time the frenche league is flagged as being not as good, so all those world class players isn't as good as if they played in Spain/England, resulting in PSG not being able to compete in Champions Cup.Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen both went to PSG on lower, even after my Barca team offered higher wages, I think it was 100K/week more than what they accepted from PSG.When I paid 209m for Kylian, I get told he is improving playing on our team because he is playing football at a higher level than what he got at PSG. (Not sure if that is fair to the French league, but that is how the in game simulation see's things.)So half my team is wanted by PSG and want to leave to play at a bigger club, but if I buy PSG players I'm apparently the stronger club.Oh and the ""played"" hours is pretty much completely fake, it takes forever to start the game due to the mostly unskipable stupid copyright screens at the beginning and load times, so for every 1 hour played, I get 23 hours of the game idling, until I return the next real world day to play again."

Regardless if these new features are  worthy to dig in or not, I can feel the effort you guys put in. The training part becomes more detailed. The Tactics are well explained and easy to configure. The transfer part becomes a little bit more realistic.But I would NOT recommend FM2020. Here is why:Have played so many gens of FM. I don't understand why the Devs make the GK so godly this year, almost unbeatable. Tell me when do you see a GK save 99% of  1 vs 1 situation in a match and how do you feel after seeing that happens in every single game you play? â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. First time in my life, I feel â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ when I play FM. Why do you do that to the players?My assumption is that the tactics in 2020 are too strong/too easy which allow players to create way too many chances in a single match. In order to make the game look not too easy, they have to stop you score that much. So their answer to this is to make the GK op instead of making the game more ""realistic"".I've read many players have the same complains in the comment. So hope the devs can hear us and make some patch/update to fix this soon.I know I am being criticism here just because I love FM and hope it becomes better every year."

1100600,6,0,7.65612E+16,140,42,-1,720,"26 December, 2019","Pure random junk simulator, it's just a rather bad game. You can call it the 'cheating engine'. I'm a long time player, this time they made a random result game. You can be the best manager, have the best team with the best morale, still losing with the weakest team at home. You can be first after midseason and with morale top get a streak of bad results ruining your whole season. So, if you don't like to cheat, you will collect bad results at home against weak teams; then you will eventually win again away against good teams. It's just frustrating, instead of improving it Sports Interactive worsened it. Beautiful presentation, broken game (it's clearly designed badly); before or later it will cheat, that's it. An insult to Sigames customers. Just try to exploit the engine and be happy about it, otherwise it will frustrate you. How you do it? It's simple, just remove forwards and add wingers, because the somewhat laughable match engine expect it; it's strong against forwards and weak against wingers, so don't dream about your tactic, the one that it works is the one that it's going to exploit the match engine. It's not about having the best team with a coherent tactic, but having a good team playing an exploiting tactic. Unhappy to have spent so much money for this year iteration. It must be said that it is become an elephant. It's slow in day by day progression (it can take 20 to 30 minutes for a virtual week, so you are going to waste more time than in the past) and the GUI graphics is fat, too much rich and boring like the match engine; luckily, I've been able to find an excellent skin that at least add spices to that depressive 'dull english art with added punk', it's called Heffem and it's made by Krysler, a bold artist; unfortunately it doesn't support very large fonts, well... I'll adapt to it; it's sacrifices a bit of readability (stretched fonts) but it adds coolness, a colorful and complete environment with a great match day graphics. So, all in all, shame on the (cheap) designers/coders responsible of all of this. The game system needs to be overhauled, or better... remade, certainly shrinked.On the pros must cite the inclusion of new roles in the match engine that add a bit of variety (not much, some roles aren't that much diversified) and the inclusion of analysts for scouting. Also, the transfer market to me looks better than before. Scouting, as a whole, looks less intuitive and streamlined. Sigames put a patch on micromanagement, that aspect can be (almost) serenely offloaded to staff members. 3D match engine graphics are better than before (that's what sold me, unfortunately I didn't knew about the newly featured 'random junk engine')."

1100600,0,0,7.65612E+16,143,1,1,632,"26 December, 2019","Slightly better than last years in part. Overall based on hours played I am obviously OK with this game but I do have a number of annoyances which come up alot with the hundreds of hours I play. Can be a bit annoying with the change of how responsibilities work, feels like they added more granularity but also took some previous away. (I.e. telling U21 and U18 to not use same tactics as first team is not obvious?) Does not always give the opportunity to include board promises when doing contract extensions.I like the new team selection suggestion mail from your assistant which highlights things like training performance and promises which helps. I like the mentoring groups. Very over priced compared to past few years considering only incremental updates to game and DBI ideally wish they corrected / improved the following: - Allow you to multi select to give praise/ critiicism to players for training effort- more player talk options as at times they only give outcomes that will only result with an unhappy player- Board overriding buying and selling amounts to block transfers , i.e. they dont want you to sell for a rubbish player to get anything you can (and they value the player at 50% more - which no-one will ever pay) - at the same time if you leave the club to auto recruit players they will pay ridicuilious amounts to buy (and wages to go with it). - game needs more NFT turning - can be sluggsh during matches (and I am doing 2D overview so not huge graphic rendering required). My machine is auto spec'd for high performance. - Like last year the in game shouts need some work. 'Get Creative' or 'Demand more' seem to be the only ones that result in a positive outcome ('Praise' only works if your smashing the other team and its mid 2nd half onwards). All others  have a negative outcome - like 'Encourage' - wtf does encouragement have a negative impact (at any point in the game from what ive tried). - Email that tells you players picked up positive and negative personality traits from their mentoring groups - but not which those are (so you can look at have them in a group that focuses on removal of those negative ones).  - I liked before where I wasnt running U21 and U18 teams, but could easily setup friendly games for them via my main schedules calendar, but thats not present (I gather I need to be fully managing those teams before I can). - You join a new club with an existing roster and its like you just bought the team in terms of their team chemistry for on field partnerships. Likewise if I buy two players who played together last year or more into my club - they have no strong partnership - like strangers. - some players with low work rate or weak strength, no matter how many months you put them on individual programs to correct those, some never get better. Any player hitting the gym or doing endurance work as a pro althelete will improve (im not talking getting someone to 20 in each, im talking going from a 5 anything higher than a 5. Specifically players like 50 mil + wingers). - As a manager, id still love the ability to be able to use my career earnings to go and buy a team in lower leagues and build them up as an owner manager. (or keep working say in Prem league and hire someone else to manage my club). Owning a club and be the manager would allow you to avoid all the dumb board decisions and it could happen in real life. (Just look at Salford FC). There is lots more, but if this was my first FM game id be pretty happy."

In all my hours playing this i have not seen a single goal where a player can pass to another for a tap in even if they are free. your attackers will miss around 90 percent of 1v1s no matter what their stats are. Your defence will always allow through balls and give away 1v1s for opposition no matter how deep and back you play them, there is no such thing as offside trap. the players look like headless chickens that run after a ball even when you ask not to press. as bad a the Ai was in previous games, it has actually  gone backwards from there to a point where the game is just un enjoyable. i sit there re-setting the game from a previous load for the first time since FM 2007 because my Bipolar team will play completely different every time. its like gambling at slots. no strategy works. you can beat the strongest teams in the game then get hammered by 20th place team 5 - 0. players sometimes forget that they are playing a game and take a stroll on the pitch when the ball is next to them. this game is ridiculous and every year my hopes go up that they may improve the AI on match day, yet all they do is change a colour or 2 and add a new â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ tab or 2 which honestly dont even matter if the core of the game isnt good. i mean if you kept last years, even thought it was also bad, it would have been better than this one. it is upsetting knowing what could have been a potentially fantastic game has failed because of lazy developers that have done â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in the past 5 years. the AI has not changed, and again, if anything it has regressed. great work you turds!If you would like to play a good game play football manager 2007 or 2008. sadly there is no 3d Engine on it but the AI and excitement that you could get out of it was much much more satisfying."

I really regret buying this game, even though the signs were bad this year. SI really doesn't give a damn about it's long time customers, the forums have been littered with complaints about the ME, yet they don't do anything. This game probably be playable around march, but I didn't pay 50$ to have a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ beta game UNTIL MARCH. I feel robbed of my money, the game is just unplayable and unsatisfying as hell.

1100600,15,0,7.65612E+16,11,1,-1,465.5,"22 December, 2019","I've felt that these games have been decreasing in quality rapidly over recent years. The last couple of FM games that I've played, the match engine just hasn't played realistically and there was always a disconnect between the tactics being implemented and the game that plays out on the pitch. So, when a friend told me that FM 2020 was amazing and way better than previous versions, I guess I just wanted to believe it too badly and I stumped up the cash for this season's offering. Sadly, I have to say that I feel this latest game is even poorer than it's predecessors. I know that a lot of people are now sick of the rudimentary 3D graphics of the match simulations in Football Manager, but I'm honestly not too bothered about that. I played Championship Manager when it was just text commentary and subsequently the 2D pitch and I had a blast with those games. My sole issue is the match engine and how the matches play out. Now, I can only imagine how difficult it must be to have a game with thousands of different teams in different leagues and different countries, where any given game played should offer a fairly realistic simulation experience. I certainly wouldn't know where to start creating something that complex. Given the complexity in creating this kind of accurate simulation that evolves alongside the modern game, I do expect a certain amount of rough edges and anomalous occurrences, which have always been present throughout the series. However, watching the matches in FM 2020 does not feel like watching a real football match. The way that the games flow and the strange occurrences that play out on field makes for quite a confusing and frankly boring experience. Many others have identified some of the recurring issues in the match engine, but the ones that I'm most affected by (constantly) are:- Too many goals from long shots- Too many chances in the penalty box being missed/saved when the attackers' stats would suggest that a goal is a very likely outcome- Wide players with good crossing and vision stats on the ball with multiple options in the box and either no cross being attempted or the cross gets blasted into a nearby defender's shins.- Players not taking obvious options e.g. several open team mates in passing range, but knock the ball out for a corner instead.- Team instructions that seem to get ignored e.g. defend wide, but all of the defence is constantly clumped together in the box.I could go on, but it seems pointless to enumerate the issues that have already been flagged dozens of times by others. What appears to be happening is that the game is trying to create an accurate simulation in terms of outcome (scorelines) whilst not being too concerned what happens on the pitch to reach that conclusion. I can accept that being an important part of the simulation experience. However, what I am witnessing within the matches themselves makes it too difficult for me to diagnose what I actually need to do to improve my tactics etc. What plays out on the field seems so disconnected from the tactics that I have selected that it often feels like a process of trial and error to find a tactic that the game approves of and then I'm left scratching my head wondering what the underlying reason for that is. Rather than seeing my team fail and being able to tell from the gameplay that my team are playing too narrow or too high up the field and that it's obviously creating vulnerabilities, my team can actually appear to play quite well, but consistently fall victim to ""bad luck"" instances. Ultimately, I don't feel like I have as much control as I'd like and it's just not fun to be essentially trying to guess what the game is thinking in order to succeed.The only other thing maybe worth mentioning is that the set piece routines feel like they could be improved. For attacking corners, it feels like my players just ignore my instructions. For defending corners, I feel as though every substitution or change in lineup means that I have to re-assess the corner routine and make sure that I haven't now got a player that's 5 feet tall trying to mark the opposition's main goal scoring threat. I'm honestly not sure how best to overhaul this, but it's a part of the game that I find really tedious.I fear that nothing will change as long as football management sims are a monopoly. There's probably no reason to improve the game if nobody else can produce a superior product and the majority of customers are content to play as Liverpool/City/PSG/Barca etc. and just brute force the game with high stat players. Any criticisms can just be waved away with ""You must be tactically inept"", so I guess that there's not much to be done. I only write this as an opportunity to vent my frustration of spending a lot of time trying to give this game a fair shake, in vain, but also so that other people thinking about buying the game will maybe read this and spare themselves the unnecessary expense and heartache."

Either your keeper turns into Jesus incarnate or your strikers turn into double agents trying their best to help the other team not concede. The fullbacks turn into Xavi/Iniesta with the accurate 40yd passes (which you'll miss anyway) and a simple lob from the opposition CB's splits you open with ease. Don't recommend buying till like June next year when they hopefully fix the god awful engine.Like: everything else aside from the match engine.

1100600,0,0,7.65612E+16,61,11,1,94.2,"16 September, 2020","I don't often play sports games. When I do though, they mainly consist of racing titles such as F1, or Assetto Corsa. And, in this case, Football Manager. I'm still relatively green, so to speak, to this series, starting with 2019 last year. As someone who does enjoy football, I felt as though I'd be doing myself a disservice not trying out FM2019. I enjoyed it, of course. That's why I'm here writing a review for FM2020.I will be honest. I suck at this game. But. Honestly? That's part of the fun. A lot of FM's charm comes from the audacious (and scarily realistic) it can be at times. For instance, in 2025, Manchester United re-sign Cristiano Ronaldo for Â£200 million, or something ridiculous. And FM has gotten these kinds of things correct in previous titles. The amount of control you get is second to none. I mean. It has to be. You're the manager. Other football titles such as FIFA and PES offer a more casual experience, but lack any sense of control with what you do. You control one player at a time and have to pray and hope the AI doesn't decide to alt+F4 itself. (In FIFA's case, it does that all the bloody time) Football Manager, on the other hand, is more complex than that. While you don't control any single player, you do control how the team behaves. Do they go for the attack, wanting to demolish their opposition? Do they sit back and defend for their lives to win a relegation 6-pointer or prevent their title rivals getting the upper hand on them?If you are inclined to, you can always start from the ground up as a new and upcoming football club. From the grass-roots of Sunday League, where players eat pie and chips with a pint of bitter to boot for breakfast; to the glory of lifting the Premier League (or Premier Division due to licensing rights; this can be changed with the free FM20 Editor add on) trophy. TL;DR - if you're a football fan and you've not played Football Manager, where have you been? If you want complete control over your team, this is the game for you. Trust me; you'll never go back to the overpriced roster updates FIFA and PES."

I can also live with inconsistent results and performances, but how many times does the AI need to score in the 90th minute when you are controlling the game  for this to be considered unrealistic (I appreciate tactical changes), but some of them just do not make sense, such as you have 70% possession, the opposition have 0 shots, and then  construct two moves completely not in keeping with either the match, the prescribed outlook of the manager, or the players involved - not to mention my players forget tactics that they have been using without issue in previous matches - it's like once the game gets to 90 minutes, teams are automatically managed by a robot Jurgen Klopp, despite how they've played for the previous 90 or previously during the season"

However this year i have give up playing it after only a short amount of the. The gameplay is shocking and the developers aren't fixing it. Wingers are constantly shooting at the keeper instead of crossing in the ball or cutting it back. And strikers miss 99/100 chances so you could have 35 shots on target and not a single goal. Considering it is Â£40 now it is dog shi*e.I wont be playing it again unless fixes to the game are introducedEdit: despite a few fixes the gameplay is still very dissapointing and the worst i have seen on a fm game. Each game consists of balls over the top of the oppositions or my defence and the striker scoring every 1 in 7 games or the wing players dribbling past the wing backs and instead of cutting back or crossing the ball in the box they shoot straight at the keeper. Whilst there has been slight improvents the game is still very boring after 5 games. On the other hand leaving out gameplay i am impressed with the other aspects of the game.

It's not enough IT'S SIMPLY GARBAGE for all the money they make2) Do you think it's normal that you get a 15 years old player and after 6 years his weight and height it's still the same? What's wrong with you developers and costumers to realise that's not realistic?3) It's December and we're playing a League game at night and the temperature is 1Â°C, it's time to substitute a player, you go to tactics and send your player in...Without sending him to WARM UP first? You know what's gonna happen if after 20 secs that guy gets hit on the leg and he is totally cold? DO YOU THINK THAT IS REALISTIC?4) Chairman's and Owners don't have their personalities, style, or goals. Do you think all the clubs that play a League are there to win something? Some owners just want to MAKE A PROFIT and that's it. They want to make profits through Sponsors, Tickets, Transfermarkt, TV etc. Some of them don't care about anything but money. Where are the OUTSIDE PITCH GOALS OF A CLUB ? do you think its realistic ?5) you can't decide about merchandise, ticket price, sponsorship NOTHING BUT THE DAM squad business6) Where is the networking (MOST AGENTS AND CLUBS AND COACH develop relationship with each other and these people will then propose their players just to the ones they have relationship with) THIS DOESN'T EXIST IN THIS JOKE OF A GAME AND I THINK IT'S TIME TO ADD THIS FEATURE7) the price...for what? seriously for what, we have to download the game, the logos, fix the colours of the competitions, the kits (one by one), the facepack, the colours of the Brazilian clubs, WTF ???!!! if this game is what it is, it's mostly thanks to the ppl that create all the features to make this garbage fun8) the ""3D"" I mean go to Youtube and look for PC CALCIO 2001 and look at their 3d, that was made 20 years ago and looks better than FM20, I won't add any other comment about that. That should make everyone reflect (I personally never played 3d I don't care but it p***es me off when you talk about the ""improvements"" you make to that c**p every year9) Transfer market with exchanges it's simply IMPOSSIBLE to make10) the individual training does barely make improvements11) It's simply RETARDED that a RIGHT WINGER can fully manage that position but if you put him as RIGHT MIDFIELDER the majority of them is gonna RED and completely DUMB !!! Imagine this: you have a player playing as Right winger and he is completely comfortable doing it, then you ask to play more defensively, about 15 meters back AT THAT POINT YOUR PLAYER LOOKS SHOCKED AT YOU AND STARTS SLAPPING HIS FACE AND SAYING DA DA DA DA like he has DOWN SYNDROME (no offense) cause in that position he is RED and he can't play.I HOPE A NEW COMPETITOR WILL COME AROUND, SO YOU GUYS CAN CLOSE YOUR LEGAL MONEY COLLECTOR GAME AND BYE BYE, I'm asking a refund IT'S TIME TO CHANGE, THIS ISN'T POSSIBLE ANYMORE"

Same story as every other incarnation - having 30-40 shots per game and failing to score more than a couple of goals, whereas opposition score from almost every chance, inexplicable decision making, clunky wooden player movements.... same old, same old.Still, when idiots like me continue to buy it, they don't need to invest to improve it, do they?!I get that it is a simulation game, and its about the strategy not the graphics. But nothing that happens when you watch the game is reflective of the instructions given to players, so it would be better to remove the match simulation if they aren't willing to improve it. 'Run at defence', 'hit early crosses', 'cross from deep' may as well be removed, because the players never do any of them. A personal favourite is seeing your player shoot (usually from a ridiculous angle) and it gets blocked by a defender, then ricochets back into your own six yard box!! Are these players made out of concrete?!The decisions players make are laughable; apparently world class players shooting from impossible angles, hitting shots straight at the goalkeeper instead of squaring it to an unmarked team-mate, and playing suicide passes across the front of their back four are evident numerous times in every game.Aside from the match engine, there is also very little scope for digging out a bargain. In FM19, it was possibly too easy to pick up young, cheap players who would go on to become stars, but this version has gone to the other extreme. You find a half-decent youngster playing for a village team in Nigeria, and his club want Â£25m for him. Again, they just can't get the balance right. What is desperately required is a rival game, ideally made by people who understand football. The makers of FM have become lazy and complacent as despite how bad the game continues to be, there is very little competition in this space."

The number of one on ones missed or saved is what really ruins the game for me, the players trying to shoot from the byline or wingers shooting from a tight angle when there is someone in the centre free is just the cherry on the cake and I don't like cherries so it just compounds the misery for me.The transfer system is as standard, a player you own is worth say 10mil, a club will offer 8 and said player will be upset that you reject the offer. A player another clubs owns is worth 10mil, they want 30mil and no ones bats an eyelash when you refuse to pay it.The game feels like it is missing something, it feels pretty one dimensional now, it has a drop down box for the role when a club offers you a job, but you can only ever be a manager, it seems as though SI thought about putting things like head coaches and interim managers in, but decided not to, which is a shame as it could have been tied into the club vision quite nicely, with some clubs operating where you are the head coach and have little to no say in your TD or DOF appointments as well as the transfers, which does happen at some clubs.I feel at some point SI will have to be bold at some point and offer the user a chance to be a reserve manager, academy manager or a director of football, as there is only so much they can do and rehash every year before it well and truly becomes stale, which if they continue down the path they have for the last few editions, could be in the near future.But overall, it is not THAT far off, its needing some system tweaks, but like I said, at some point, SI will have to make a bold move"

Both performance wise with lag (even on 2D) and in game animations/player decisions/broken mechanics etc. The lack of patches is shocking from SI. We already have to wait several months into a new football season to play the game then when it drops they barely patch. Should be weekly patches on a game with so many problems.

Yet I find that everything is laggish/sluggish, not just the match engine, but the menus too. It's like everything is running in slight slowmotion that throws you off.I looked up potential solutions and noted that people had found that downloading custom skins could solve the problem - and it did for many people. Sadly not for me, though. And besides, you shouldn't have to rely on 3rd party items to solve something as basic as perfomance. Until the performance is fixed I cannot recommend this game. You most likely (?) wont run into this problem, but even if it's only a fraction of us it's unacceptable when the game costs 55 euros."

(20.2.6)- Supper Keepers are back- World Class ST will miss 5-7 CCC for every goal they score- Re-ranking is broken as well. If you had a good season, next season every team will defend against you.

1100600,3,0,7.65612E+16,104,2,-1,209.1,"16 December, 2019","I'd start this by ensuring you that I play the game since 1999 and I loved and also hated it ever since, despite the match engine is broken EVER SINCE! I played nearly every iteration in the last 20 years. I just can't understand why nobody could fix the match engine like ever. Below I tell you some examples for FM2020:I play Dortmund right now, but the same thing happens with mostly all the teams I tried to manage...1. Magic goal at the last second of the game:Sometimes when the match engine realises that I'm having a better result that (according some hidden rule) I should have, then it corrects itself with a last second goal for the opposing team. It's really last second, so there's no replay, only the match ends and I realise on the scoreline that I lost. (there was also no scoring chance, or passes before, it just happens out of thin air) That bug can really break something deeply inside me...2. My players are having a bad day:This issue goes back a long time now, it existed more or less in every iterations of FM. If the RNG generates a bad number for you before the match then you CANNOT win. I've tried to reload the match as long as I got bored (after an hour or so) and every single time I've lost against a much weaker team. (maybe a few draws) I had like 3x the chances yet my players magically forgot how to score. I hit all the posts and crossbar 10 times, the rest goes over or their goalkeeper gets a 8.5 result after saving EVERYTHING. Then the other team goes once inside my box, and they score one from EVERY chance. This is also ridiculous.2/b: I think that decision before the match is a real thing, as for example competition draws are decided BEFORE the draw. I checked it by saving on the draw day but BEFORE the draw itself. The I reloaded and drew again getting the same exact result over and over again. I getting to belive that matches work about the same. They are decided before, and ""simulation"" is only eyecandy, but the result (win or loose) is mostly decided before. You can only change in the match how bad it will be...3. Teams play better with 10 man as with 11:Also goes back a long time with FM. You are getting a good amount of chances and faring ok in the match maybe even leading by 1-2 goals. Then the opposite team looses a man with red card. After that they magically turn into 10 Messies and beat you up with no chance to counter them. Even if you switch to DEFENSIVE AGAINST A 10 MAN TEAM!! If on theother hand YOU loose a man you are as good as dead, they destroy you...4. Opposing players magically learn to play football in the middle of the match:You are getting massive amount of chances and really destroy the opposite team leading by 2-3 goals easily. Then something happens and the opposite team comes back into the game in 10 minutes. If you are lucky you can maybe still win, or draw by the skin of your teeth, but it's often turning into a draw or loss. I've checked, they didn't change tactic or stg. They just learned how to beat me in 10 minutes. 5. Equalizing from kick-off after goal:You score a goal, and the opposite team equalises from the kick off after 2 touches. I'm getting this in 2-3 out of 5 games.Right now this 5 things annony me really after my last couple of matches, but I'm sure I could come up with 5 more if I weren't really pissed off.All-in-all in this state of match engine you need to be a real fan of the game (like me) to play it, otherwise you will start to hate it for the rest of your life. I still hope that it will somehow be fixed, and I can really play it like it was meant to be, but in it's current state I cannot recommend you to buy and play the game. Wait until it will be fixed (if ever).Update: Right after writing the report:https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1938497356"

There are times when you want to give up on playing it because the simulation can screw with you to the point where you don't believe that it's possible to be screwed over any more. For example, Barcelona + Pogba + Sancho losing to a team like Mallorca 3-0, while Barcelona gets 2 shots the whole 90min. Then there are times where your team, that you spent hours putting together, actually comes together and plays to expectations. That's what's so satisfying about this game. Building a team of young stars and old ones that can compete against the best teams and come out victorious. Overall, for this game to enjoyable you have to actually spend some time building up a team, meaning multiple seasons not just one. If you think you can spend time on a single game for hours at a time, and you enjoy building a football team into your own vision, then you should definitely give this a try.

I cannot even begin to estimate how many times I have dominated games in possession, shots & shots on target yet suffered defeat. On a very frequent basis I see my team generating well over twenty shots and over ten on target yet lose the game to a team generating only 2 or 3 shots. I recall this being a football manager curse over many seasons and hasn't been addressed, it simply isn't realistic and to say it happens in 2 out of every 3 games I play really wouldn't be an exaggeration. I accept it may happen from time to time but it is happening in virtually every game I play.Method of goals being conceded is also dull, repetitive and unrealistic. I would estimate that 90% of the goals I concede are from balls lumped over the top to the striker who scores one on one with the keeper, I have tried lots of different instructions & formations to my defence but to no avail. This may be less frustrating if my strikers didn't miss 90% of their one on ones. But again, wholly unrealistic.Their are other frustrating aspects to the game, particularly 16/17yr old prospects demanding moves to a bigger club before they are even good enough to break into the reserves never mind the first team. Undeterred they also demand promises of first team football in contract negotiations regardless of their talent, they just can't be reasoned with.Media interaction seems to have changed little and the same boring, repetitive, pointless unrealistic questions crop up without an option to say anything even remotely like what you would like to say in response. Of course you can you send your assistant to say all the wrong things if you prefer. Surely this could be more imaginative.I don't want the game to be easy, I want it to be fair. The vast majority of the games I play leave with me with the feeling of having been cheated, it's almost as if the game wants you to lose.The most damning verdict I can give of any game is that is simply isn't fun and sadly this version of football manager not only isn't fun, it's a chore."

1100600,0,0,7.65612E+16,66,2,1,974.3,"7 December, 2019",In my opinion this is the best iteration of FM I have played. However there are still negatives with it though as with every game.Positives:The new development centre allows for players like me who like using younger players and youth prospects to use there own intake more often.The game is much better (in my opinion) at predicting and producing realistic results whilst also providing upsets such as in my personal Ipswich career gave me an fa cup win over Everton but a league thrashing by a newly relegated Southampton.Negatives:I do think that the way you find and approach free agents could do with an improvement as you should have a level of knowledge about their ability as well as be able to search for them specifically as a separate section instead of a broad transfers section.I also think the way that interviews for prospective jobs need to be altered as on many occasions a chairman will question me about things that haven't happened to me such as media controversy.Overall I really do enjoy this game and I will probably play it for a long time yet. Or at least until the next one comes out.

How many times do I need to hit the woodwork 3 times or more? You go look at Piatek's finishing and penalty attributes but he only scores 5 or less goals a season as a regular starter and missed all 4 of his penalties in regular time until i hooked him off penalty duties forever! It is no use creating the best tactics and get your team to shoot from close range and get plenty of shots at goal when the FM creators want you to miss it. I've missed the last FM cos of this, and i am totally regretting giving this a shot. The 3D match engine is a horror as usual but it is not even the biggest bugbear. I know there aren't a decent alternative out there but come on FM fanboys, please critique this game fairly. It is crap. Period."

I enjoyed the 2019 version enormously, and I'm only in the foothills of coming to grips with the 2020 offering, so everything that follows is provisional. But it looks hugely promising. More things you can work with which gets you even deeper into the game. The ways you can manage the tactical setup of the team are better and the game engine seems to have changed.There seems to have been a step backward, though, in that player AI seems to have failed to get forwards to stay onside again. This was a pain in the backside in previous issues, but was far better in 2019. Seems to have got lost again in the new version, leading to unrealistic numbers of offside calls.Also one disappointment. You can only specify the first ball in set plays - so you have the corner to the near post, but you cannot then specify, for instance, that the man at the near post heads down for an onrushing player.. The management of set plays has been static for some time and I would dearly like it to expand for corners and free kicks and also to offer moves you can set up in open play. Understand it might be technically complicated, but- for me at least - it would open a whole new dimension."

1100600,5,0,7.65612E+16,56,1,-1,559.4,"5 December, 2019","Tl;Dr 3/10 at best. Get it on sale if you have too. Personally wont be buying future versions of the game until below issues are addressed. This game is basically just a database update on FM19. Sure they added some small, new features like the ""development center"" and detailed contract negotiations but don't let that layer of gloss fool you. The ""bread & butter"" aka the match engine and tactical aspects of the game are completely crap.  Also, graphics are still very poor compared to other smaller budget games of the same genre.Some examples:- Fullbacks and wide players won't make obvious passes or crosses in the final third. Half of your highlights will be this.....over and over and over again.....especially infuriating when you're behind. - Your tactical instructions will be completely ignored. Ex: Set an instruction for your center-mid with superb stats for ""teamwork"" to ""shoot less""? Screw that. He'll shoot from odd angles and distances anyways. Icing on the cake is that, more often than not, he'll often even score.- Forwards are even worse. Clear-cut chances that even your grandma wouldn't miss, go begging. This will be the other half of your highlights for most games. - Through balls and passing is still kinda unrealistic and wonky. Most through balls don't...well..go through. While passing is just silly from time to time with players constantly switching the ball to the opposite flanks as if everyone is Paul Scholes or Pirlo. Side criticisms of the game:- $50 dollars and they don't even have critical licenses, kits or logos like for Juve.- Graphics are still very outdated compared to much lower budget games of the same genre.- Weird lag, glitches and bugs can be found from time to time. Ex: blank screen appearing rather than the pitch during 3D matches when using custom skins. - Game feels too script-y. I don't know how to explain this but I just don't ""feel"" like I am playing the game anymore. Everything feels scripted like there's coded scenarios or animations for every possible input I make tactically. I hope I make sense. Maybe add more scripts so the game at least feels rich and realistic, idk?Overall I definitely won't be purchasing any future versions of the game after being a FM fan for over a decade with thousands of hours of game time."

Strikers of Kane and Pellegri and yet cant get more than a 1-0 game. Wingers constantly shooting from impossible angles and dont pass when the striker is in a scoring position even when I set 'shoot less often' and 'cross more often' tactics.

1100600,5,1,alexyz-h2o,20,1,-1,593.3,"2 December, 2019","Due to sub-par Match Engine the game ceased to be as realistic as it used to be. It is incredibly and painfully frustrating to witness:- the strikers missing so many 1-on-1 chances (despite decent attributes)- wingers/wing-backs shooting the ball into the side netting rather than crossing (despite instructions)- players missing more penalties than they score (again despite decent attributes)At least one of the above happens 2-3 times per game. At first, when you are excited with the new features, you ignore it and focus on the good stuff. But when you are 80 hours into the game - honestly there is nothing much you can draw your attention to. To sum up, the game is enjoyable, but is a step back in the series and is totally not worth its price. It is beyond my understanding how did the devs not spot these issues during testing."

I had high hopes for this one, but there are only superficial additions which are almost useless or well past due date, while match engine (including 3D) is on almost comical level. Number of missed one on ones goes into hundreds during the season - you will simply stop caring if your player is clean through or in good chance, because he won't finish 9/10 chances. Even players with 20 teamwork are not able to square pass into better position for tap in, everyone is attempting shots from 90 degree angle. Sweeper keepers are watching people round them in small box. UX is horrible, interactions largely same as past 5 years and negotiations simply unengaging, probably unfinished. I long for a days, when Football Manager was so advanced, you could actually set up your team formation for defensive and offensive phase.   Its great thats game sells more units every year, but it has probably more to do with marketing. Like the SI guys, but this title is simply so weak, it really starts to remind me of whole FIFA cycle."

Don't get me wrong it's a good game, but still has it's issues like every FM has (and probably will), this one to me seems a little more perfected but it doesn't stop some down right perplexing things happening during matches. There are a few nice additions this time around, like the development centre so you can focus on youth growth. More staff positions add a realistic feel and give you more options to delegate tasks to. Club vision now allows you to make a five year plan with your board adding to the overall feel of being the manager of a club. Is it better than FM 19, to me yes. Is it a radical change that makes you ""feel wow...this is so new..."" no it is not. It's a game for long term fans of the series but is a great entry point for new players, it feels very accessible and there are plenty of websites out there to give help with guides and tactics. I find the UI is easy to navigate and easy to find what you're looking for.I'm hoping to see some issues addressed in future patches but that of course remains to be seen. Eg. Youth players demanding ridiculous wages, penalty conversions I have had an issue with though it's been better since the last patch.There are more that many others I am sure have mentioned so I won't bother with a long boring list to read through.

Like forwards struggling with one-on-ones (!?!?!) and players taking impossible angled shots instead of making an obvious pass. You'll cheer and you'll curse so i guess the end result is good enough.GRAPHICS>>>>>>>>3Bad. So bad that a lot of ppl don't even use the 3-D match engine and still use the older 2-D mode or even the text only mode. Fifa 2000 has better graphics. The vanilla user interface and menu layout is not great and has only changed its colours the last 8 years. Most ppl play with user made UI's.MUSIC&SOUND>>>>5Average. No music. Sound effects are ok, they do the job. But little to no attempt to incorporate more stadium atmosphere or teams chants. POLISH>>>>4Average. This series has a reputation of not making any major changes to the core experience. With every years game basically being a database update. Every edition needs a patch to sort numerous issues out from the launch version. You could for example play FB manager 2012 and not notice to much difference in overall experience. With the most notable changes since then being more depth surrounding injuries(sigh) and some minor interface changes and menus that show things that used to be hidden like team hierarchy, squad dynamics. Which since i can remember has been part of the game, players just lacked visual representation of those aspects.REPLAY VALUE>>>>8.5Good, almost great. Mainly a single player game but multiplayer is possible, as well as steam leader boards. If you are big football fan and really get into this game it could really suck you in and you could find yourself putting hundreds of hours into this. You could play with one team to the year 2100 if you manage not to get fired or you could jump around to different leagues or even manage international teams if you are bored of club football. For me the game gets really interesting when the original ""real player"" database is fazed out eventually and gets replaced by newly generated players and where scouting becomes one of the most fun parts of the game. OVERALL>>>>>>>>57%Objectively not a good game. The core game is decent enough but the devs havn't given players anything new and substantial for years. The mechanics are questionable, the graphics are plain bad and the sound is average. This game prides itself on its database and simulation but that has been largely unchanged for nearly a decade. The only reason why you would buy the newest FB manager is to get a updated database which doesn't justify the price. No real reason for players of older versions to get this one but if you are football mad, like management games and haven't bought any older FB manager games then it would definitely be worth a try."

Now you can take charge of exactly as many duties as you want and the game feels so much smoother and more fun and you have the peace of mind knowing every aspect of your club is being used reasonably effectively. Obviously you get best results by reading guides online and implementing it yourself but to save you time and stress this feature is really usefulMan Management:In FM19, regardless of my Discipline stat, players were kicking down my door every 5 minutes to whine about something. I'm happy to report they've reigned this in significantly for FM20, yes you still get issues but they seem to be more grounded in what is actually happening.Feedback:SI have really revamped the amount and quality of feedback you receive so it's now much more clear what you are doing that's working and what you need to change on a variety of frontsIn game:Other criticisms you're seeing are right, you don't score many one-on-ones regardless of quality and pressing seems to lead to high number of bookings, but it's the first version of FM where I'm clearly seeing the tactics I'm selecting actually playing out, YMMV. Seem to score from range a lot more consistently though, so it's swings and roundabouts.It's worth checking out if you're looking for a experience that CAN be less intimidating and slow, but allows veterans to delve into all the minutiae of this very deep management sim."

This game should be renamed Crash Football because the Si Forum is littered with people complaining about the game crashing or not loading . This is typical of Si every year the game is released in an unfinished format and then you have to rely on Fixes and updates . Always one before Xmas then one after and if your lucky another one in March and then its on to the next years game . By the time you get to play it its due for a new release . I have counted 10,000 posts in there bug section on there forum at this time and the game has only been out 3 weeks . There is no competition for this franchise and they treat there public with discontent every year . You cant even complain on there forum as you get banned . Poor Match Engine coupled with poor graphics make this laughable but the interface is good before it crashes . Jittery graphics which has plagued this game since 2018 has still not been fixed . Lots of potential in this game is let down by a poor company with budgets and time restraints . Strangely enough FM17 is a far better game . As a score for a review having played Football Manager since FM2008 i would give it a 45 / 100 not the 85s or 90s that the payed reviews from game sites give  . Download the demo and try for yourself though as this is just my thoughts"

Thank you for making me realise that i have other unplayed games in my library. How this game got positive ratings is beyond me.

The tiny tweaks that they did add are brilliant. The game engine is still absolute shxt and ugly and Miles is still an ignorant piece of work who won't accept any sort of criticism or opinion that differs from his own. I recommend you get it just so you have updated transfers, new development centre and other features like that. Isn't worth Â£40 though. It feels like they could have just added this as a DLC to the last game. There is one problem I find at the moment and that is penalties. Whenever I have a penalty, I'll score 1 in 20. If my opponent has a penalty, he'll miss 1 in 20. That is annoying. Anyway, highly addictive as always, but not much of a change from 19 so don't expect much."

1100600,17,0,7.65612E+16,210,1,-1,222.8,"27 November, 2019",I do not get it why so many people give a good review. It is basically the same game as last year with mini changes. So it cost 55 euros for a game that has no minor changes to last year. What makes me really want to scream at this year FM are two things besides of the broken match engine:1. not good looking graphics - do you actually have a art director or somebody with a good esthetic feel? The 3d Graphic are not appealing at all. It is as you are playing a game from 2005 or worse. Stadium looking all the same. Even if you do not have the licens just do a bit on an afford to build stadium which maybe looking nearly the same es the originals. The light in 3d mode is off - it is not a very good atmosphere. And the most funny part is the weird looking black dots on the grass to simulate that the usage of the pitch. I really do not get this at all.2. animation of the players are - how do i say it - weird. Player sliding over the pitch or moving strange. They do not behave as they should in a 2019 engine. But overall it is the best football manager right now - it is actually the only one or i would say there is no competition. So maybe this is why it feels as you playing the 2019 version with half assed changes.You have a big publisher on hand and i am not sure why it is like this. It feels like that the match engine got dummer. If you watch the whole game you can see that something feels of. Just read the forums. I guess many people are not happy with it.I just do not want to buy a database every year. I want also good graphics and a good engine. Please get somebody for your team that can make it happen.

The development center is a nice upgrade to get a quick snapshot view of promising youth players. The in-game engine seems better (I tend to play with better teams so maybe the difference is more notable there) and players' touches and passes seem to look and feel better.With the good, there is of course the not-so-good.1) Bugs. In the staff tab, when I click on ""youth team staff""(u-19 or reserves), sometimes the click does not work. It just sits there. This also happens vice-versa when i am in the u-19 staff menu and i click on ""first team staff"" and of course again it doesnt work. In game, there is also issues again with inside forwards/wingers just running down line and shooting it straight at the near post. It seems like you need to have 15 vision, passing, teamwork, and the ""pass before shoot trait"" in order to get your player to actually just simply cross the ball to your open forward. Speaking of forwards, for the last 3 years pure single-striker systems struggle to have a consistent scoring striker. Maybe its just the formations I play (vertical tiki-taka for the most part) but I find it hard sometimes to get my striker to consistently score. 2) Ridiculous training injuries. Why the hell do some of my players randomly get a ""Training injury"" all the time. Also, one thing I've noticed, if you haven't saved in a while, the game will throw an injury your way. IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. I personally dislike injuries very much, but that is my preference.All in all, the game is absolutely worth getting for the FM fans and newcomer. The game does a great job in helping you progress through a campaign and set you up for the future with the new development system. I will be curious to see how they fix some of the bugs and issues in the game but once they do, the game will be perfect."

I play each game for hundreds of hours and make databases and the like. The development centre is a big plus for me, as it focuses on one of the best aspects of the game - developing wonderkids. The quality of life updates all over the shop are brilliant to have as well - you really notice the difference.The thing that makes me positive that it was a good decision is that I could never go back to FM19 now, I really like the new features and playing without them would just feel inferior now. Make of that what you will.As to the match engine, in the beta there certainly were many missed one on ones, and wingers shooting from ridiculous angles. Happily I can see that I do not experience these issues any more than I did in previous iterations of the game now. I wouldn't say the match engine is an improvement but after the updates it certainly isn't a step back anymore.Overall, if you're gonna play this game for over 100 hours, buy it. If not, save your money, or wait for a sale. It's another solid iteration which certainly makes some improvements, but isn't improving any faster than in previous years."

BUutT itS JuST YOuR TaCTiCs BroOOEDIT: As of February update the game is much better. All of the issues above have been resolved for the most part. Here are some additional issues I've noticed: The game tends to favor gegen pressing heavily, good luck sitting deep and trying to defend (although may be my tactics) Wingers and Fullbacks tend to blast the ball in a for a cross off defenders frequently, even though instructed to cross less often and playing narrow system. Annoying amount of offsides being shown on comprehensive highlights, since there is no instruction to tell the players to be more careful why show them over and over to me? Defenders frequently head/kick the ball out for a corner when they could clear it elsewhereThere is a glitch that allows you to sell your player for any sum you want (right click after offer accepted and type in whatever price you wish) Some of the descriptions are not written very clearly in what they do and how they impact the team, may be tough for new players to get into the game. Example, mentality should be rebranded as risk. Match sideline shouts are broken and/or not explained clearly in what they are supposed to do. Basically only demand more, praise (when up a goal), and get creative work, the rest just make my team lose focus for no reason. Despite the issues above I can now recommend the game."

1100600,20,1,7.65612E+16,163,16,-1,29.2,"25 November, 2019","Post Update Edit: Players now pass it into the box more often now when they have an option instead of shooting. Sometimes they do in fact shoot it from a narrow angle , but it's rather seldom. The 1v1s are still treacherous though. No improvement whatsoever.I genuinely mean this when I say it, FM20 has, without a doubt, the worst match engine SI has ever implemented. The most common complaint this game has received so far is that strikers consistently miss 1v1s. Unfortunately this problem is rampant in this game. While this has been a problem in previous FMs, I can comfortably say I have yet to see a striker score from a 1 on 1 situation in my first 12 hours of gameplay. Not. A. Single. One.What's this? My winger received an excellent through ball into the box? Oh that's great, if he strikes the ball he might sco-- why is he running all the way to the end of the pitch? Now the angle is far too narrow to get off a decent shot. Well at least he's in an excellent position to lay it off it in to my striker who's wide ope- oh he shot it at the keeper anyways.You will see this happen every game, multiple times. It will consume your highlight reel. It's completely unrealistic. Drives you mad especially when you're losing because your opponent has had one shot from long range at your keeper, and your keeper is a brain dead nonce who dives over the ball. Overlapping full backs are an absolute nightmare. Even worse than wingers. They get themselves in great crossing positions, but consistently decide to get closer to the keeper, but engage them at a narrow angle. Always. Sometimes they even shoot with their weaker foot.JUST PASS THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ BALL MATE.â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I'm going back to FM 13."

That is if the devs get their act together and pull their finger out and focus their attention to all aspects of the game. ME animations are still sub par and looks like something you would find in Actua Soccer 99. Its not all about the graphics, but the animations make it look much worse. Furthermore, the ME is buggy. Far too many one on ones via long through balls, players hardly cross anymore, the ME just feels linear and is a joke to put simplyPosted numerous bug reports but I am officially done. Nothing gets done and im fed up. The developers are far too apathetic and egotistic and are in another world. The game is no where near good enough; compare the ME too FM12 and FM14. Those were much better IMO. Im not sure what planet the devs are on or what they smoke, but their behaviour and attitude needs plenty of work. The game feels like it was made by a bunch of amateurs, and clearly it has been. Tiny studio with no many resources and it clearly depicts this with the final product. Mr Brock states he wants the ME to become as close as real life as possible. I would love to know what he puts in his tea. Firstly. the match sounds have been the same for over 15 years, and CM01/02 had better sounds. Animations still pathetic, grass still looks crappy and to prove they're a joke, they release SNOW as a new feature, but cant even get it right. Have you seen how sloppy and pathetic it looks. And one of the devs quoted that it is a feature they are working on and it will get better in future versions. Are they having a laugh?? Dont release something that looks like a grade one student just drew. It literally looks like a couple white blobs my niece jotted on a piece of paper. Disgusting and just shows the state of the game and the ME at present. Pitch marks look like black dots and are pixelated and reminds me of Doom from the mid 90s.Overall very very disappointed with the lack of progress, especially with the ME, which is their bread and butter. AI squad building still very very bad, and its relatively easy to build a champion team with pretty much any side, because the AI pulls of spastic moves and is nowhere near good enough to build a good squad. AI needs to loan much better players (lower leagues) and just improve drastically. I am not a member of their forums as I have been told that whatever you post, the moderators over there are quick to pounce on negativity which is surprising as I thought they were super helpful and bug reporting would assist in improving the game, but apparently SI have swept so many issues and bugs from previous versions and have yet to rectify them, and just provide a band aid fix. Example? Players hardly ever cross, where as in the previous 2-3 versions, you may as well have called it Crossing and Microsoft Excel simulator. That is how it felt. I highly suggest you hold off buying the game, or at least try out the demo and find out for yourself.Too late for me to get a refund, but will definitely not buy the game for the next 3-4 years as they simply dish out the same garbage every year,. and the game is not playable up until March at the very least, and that is IF they fix the issuesFM19 was a joke as strikers were pretty much useless in the game, and guess what? SI never fixed the issues at all, so the game was pretty much broken for its entire life span. How useless is that. If you are a casual FM player and dont pay attention to these issues and dont care, sure, buy the game. But if you have purchased the last 12 games, and are a hardcore player who wants realism and immersion, do not buy the game right now. It will give you PTSD and anxiety from all the bugs and hair pulling. Potentially great game designed by a small obscure studio with poor facilities without undersoil heating and poor research facilities. EDIT: Here in May, and ME is broken. Small bug like the net bulging when the ball hits it was listed as a bug in January, and was never fixed. Devs are apathetic towards the game. DO NOT BUY  a game where the devs dont even care put their heart in it."

But FM20 really has addressed many of the biggest issues from previous versions. Proabably my favourite improvement is the game engine, where balls curve now and goals (esp FKs) are so much more realistic, as are crosses. No more ridiculous early yellow cards, players can actually play two games in 7 days without being completely tired out. In my first season didn't come across any crazy scheduling issues, although I was knocked out both cups early and was not in Europe...so let's see. It's great the way you can easily delegate tasks to staff and management, depending on how busy you are with other things. So far it is the best of the modern FM games and I highly recommend it.MAJOR EDIT: Wow, now I've seen the posts from other players and realise this game is essentially broken. I'm into my 5th season with Everton, my vision was to be ""best of the rest"" and my goal was to qualify for champions league. I'm sitting in 4th with a few games to go, by far my best season....and I'm being told I failed my goals....by squad and owner. Owner BTW who is considering selling the club EVERY transfer window so I have a transfer embargo during critical times and miss out on sales or have selling deals messed up. PS I am in the semi final of Europa League when my goal was QF, not taken into account. Instead of being praised for a brilliant job (that the press is telling me I am having) instead am getting told off and having to beg to keep my job. What a load of **** sort if out. AND this stupid game is free now, what a waste of money. Never buying another version of this game."

The referees and their obsession for yellow cards and penalties, the 1v1s, your inside forwards and wingers shooting from impossible angles, your players missing from 4 yards out constantly.... This is just a selection of the annoying nonsense in FM20's match engine. I cannot believe how significantly it has regressed from FM19. Until it is improved, I cannot recommend this game even though I'll probably continue playing cause I'm just a sucker for pain and frustration.EDIT: Think It's time to change the review and recommend the game because after all the updates, my experience of the match engine is at least on par with FM19, if not better. I have hope now that my players could score a 1v1, wingers shooting from impossible angles has been fixed, 4 yard misses happen but not that frequently and the refs are not as obsessed with setting yellow card given records every game."

Literally 0. The ball will bounce off a post and NOBODY will move for it. Everybody, opposition included, now seem to ball watch.Tactics still have no effect. Disciplined, positive, short passing football- so where does my advanced forward pass it? BACK TO THE CENTRE BACK! Who is marked. Who then falls over his own feet for no reason (maybe how the ME represents balance?)Direct wing play? Game goes full back to winger, to full back, to winger- then out for a throw. F***ING CROSS IT YOU PLEBS!I dream of a match that even remotely represents life. Where my defenders move with urgency, where COMMON SENSE exists and passes aren't completely idiotic. Oh well, maybe next year (I won't be buying it).The game engine was broken on release:*Strikers that can't score from inside the 6 yard box*Wing backs who don't/won't CROSS or CUT BACK*Idiot goalkeepers who use their knees instead of their hands*Defenders who turn like a pint of milk and run the ball out of play/into their own net instead of turning sharply with urgency*Players turning onto their weak foot and misplacing passes instead of their good foot- not even under pressure.*EVERY. SINGLE. LONGSHOT. FROM 25 YARDS. FROM A PLAYER WITH 5 FINISHING. AND 5 TECHNIQUE. IN THE LOWEST LEAGUE. WILL SLAM INTO THE TOP CORNER. EVERY TIME. But a half volley from 6 yards central to the goal? Wide mate.It's just not fun, not realistic, not a fair representation of professional players. YET if you ask an SI developer on Twitter, they defend it to the death. I've had a player miss NINE clear cut chances in one game, with 13 finishing, in the National League.I've had a defender pick up the ball on his own 6 yard line, run behind the goalie and try to clear the ball, kicking it off the goalie and INTO HIS OWN NET. What's the tactical instruction for that one then? COMMON SENSE AND EYES?Sort it out SI, your game's a joke."

It is like a small update of fm 19 . biggest dissapointment is the MATCH ENGINE!!  wingers almost never pass to a player when he is free that just needs to tap in, instead they keep shooting from weird positions.. and second the one on ones are still unrealistic while the long range attempts are easier than a 1v1.. i understand the game cannot fully represent a real football game but at least these basic match engine mistakes makes it very very unrealistic to play and frustrating t..also the training system feels useles and the press conferences very boring and repetitive ... expected something more from this game .. a waste of money.. if you have fm 19 or fm 18 you are not missing much from this"

The least they could have done was fix the match engine, however it's as bad as ever. 30 plus shots in a game and you won't score, but the one chance the opposition get, they will score from. This happens game after game. The amount of 1 on 1's missed is staggering. Strikers are useless. Players never have consistent ratings from game to game, making picking a side impossible. A new feature to this version is players now constantly miss hitting shots in a way you'd expect a non-league player too. Scuffing them along the ground and wide. It's unenjoyable."

Mostly because of the match experience, it is very frustrating.  I am just a few matches away from selecting to see only the goals.  Every match ( without exceptions) my players miss at least 5-6 times one-on-one. This happens for the openent as well. There have been this kind of misses in the previous versions (which is normal, strikers miss one on ones sometimes) , but the percentage in this one is way too high. I also see a lot of errors with the off-side rule, and also a lot of weak back passes - from my midfield directly to the opposing striker. Again, way to often this things happen.

All these things should improve the already impressive replayability of FM.HOWEVER, the match engine has disappointed me again. It has similar flaws the FM19 match engine had: strikers are nearly useless, no overlapping runs from central midfield, no through balls attempted, to name a few. Even worse, wingplay has become a joke with wingers and full backs blasting shots at goal from impossible angels. All this after a lot of feedback SI got from the community during FM19 and the FM20 beta.I hope they can improve the match engine. Until then, this game gets a low score from me and I'll stick to the older FM18.Update 25 February 2020:SI has released a big patch earlier this month, also including the transfer updates up until that date. The match engine was changed as well, but this update didn't improve the experience significantly enough to change my initial review of this game.For future games, I suggest to wait to buy the game until after the winter update as you can then ask for a refund if the game doesn't fulfil your expectations. Now it's impossible to do that because you only get to see the final version of the game 4 months after the initial release.Update 8 April 2020:SI have confirmed on the SI community forum they won't release a new update for this game. As such, my negative recommendation will not change."

DIRE.  Frame rate loss and stuttering are terrible problems, and the actions of the players are just ridiculous. Players dribble for 50 yards down the pitch on a regular basis without any attempt from another player to challenge them.  You don't really feel like your decisions and tactical tweaks make much of a difference to the action either. Additionally the text bar commentary is STILL semi disconnected to what you actually see happening on the pitch.  Example :  The text will say something like "" Wow, that assist was just delightful!!""  when it was a boring and totally normal short pass that a 12 year old could make.A LOT of work and patching needs to be done to make this game worth buying.  Most of it centres around the poor match day simulation. Wait till they at least try and fix it..... and don't buy for now."

Why? because this stupid game encourages shots from the most incredibly tightest angles, wingers and full backs do not cross ever! they always run inside and shoot. Never ever do they pass across goal or drill in a low cross even though your tactics clearly state low crossing and the tactical familiarity is pretty much full. BTW in regards to the goal drought situation, please look at Harry Kane's attributes how can he keep missing so many chances. I'll tell you why! Goalkeepers are OP!!!! even the rubbish goalkeepers save shot after shot after shot after shot! This game is so trash its so unrealistic. The chemistry lines between partners take so long to link up.

Match Engine kills this game. That's it. You can spend hours with building your roster then coming up with a balanced tactic or whatever. But the match engine is so boring and lightyears from real football that it is too much for me. My centre backs score 10-15 goals from corners and indirect free kicks in one season. My CMs score 7-10 goals / player from outside of the box. In exchange my strikers and inside forwards are retarded in clear cut chances. This is not football.Update: 20.12.2019I changed the recommendation to NOT RECOMMENDED. Match engine is still not fixed which is a big problem because it is so unrealistic that I quit playing this game. I am very sad because everything is at least good in the game but the match engine (the main dish) simulates a sport which is clearly not football. 1 on 1 situations (striker against goalkeeper) almost always missed. It's like in a basketball game Lebron James would miss every second dunk... :(Update: 22.11.2019Since the last update the match engine favors the AI heavily and it is more broken than before. What I did not experience before:- 4 out 4 penalties were missed by my pen. taker (fin, pen tak. 16 rating)- My team shoots 20-30 times on goal (appr. 5-8 long shots) and create 2-5 clear cut chances, meanwhile the AI shoots max 10 per game but scores with 30% (deflected long shots, free kicks, cannon shots from anywhere by Average Joe) . And I have a defensive tactic. I couldn't win 10 games in a row... before the last update I was on a ""run"" (I am with Real Valladolid in 3rd season and in Europe League, so the ""run"" is relative definition in this case).- and in 2 weeks 6 major injuries in the squad...- I am literally sad that something messed up/made the match engine worse.What I really don't get is that how can you publish a football simulation which is appr. 20 years old in development and when you start a match and the strikers never score on 1on1s, I can't believe that the developers/testers cannot saw it. I assume SI employees are aware about that strikers tend to score when they are on 1 on 1 against the keeper and not bothered at all by any defender... please someone explain this to me.See ya after the ""real version"" is published! I am done with beta testing for my money.Update: 20.11.2019compared to fm19 and in just in general:- less major injuries (more than 3 weeks long), more minor injuries (less than a week), more realistic I think- match engine is better than fm19 but needs some refining, e.g.:- 1 on 1 finishing is a joke right now- long shots overpowered (players with a long shot attr. of 14 are Roberto Carlos Academy graduates)- wingers/fbs smashing into the sidenet from zero angle instead of crossing- majestic solos (playing for me Castrovili is Kaka at his best, the AI tends to have a Messi every second match)The problem is that you can create a team and tactic based on the long shot ""feature"" and you can kill every team. (possesion game + long shot from anywhere) And it's unreal and boring.Don't forget to create custom defensive set pieces instructions, AI tends to expose the default settings.So every part of the game is excellent (can be some bugs of course) except the match engine. Now I would put an ""untested/not tested enough"" label on the match engine. What I fear is that the 1on1 and the smash into the sidenet things won't be fixed because then every match could be 7-4. The defenders still act time to time like low IQ cows. (they turn around and start running only when the ball is behind them)"

But for the love of god its the 2nd generation now that wont allow strikers to go wide when you tell them to go wide in individual instructions. That was the same in 2019, and it effected attacking mids and defensive mids. They Just all stand next to each other in the center of the pitch instead of further apart. Also playing with a back 3 and having wide midfielders come back has improved a bit, but they still tend to wander off before possession has been secured. Still early days in game atm, so might find a way of not having to resort to wing backs dropping back way to deep to make a backline of 5 so that high presses arent as effective."

Now granted the game was released with a lot of cosmetic bugs things like not being able to delete notes and fine players etc however game play was fantastic I would count myself as the majority who just want to sign scout and train players and get on with things and do well with the odd challenge and let things develop season on season as better players come in,However now that they have patched the game it has become so bloody boring, my team which is full of world class players and stars in the making now barely beat the weak teams by a goal and are losing and drawing against teams they should annihilate even lost 4-1 when I was drawing 1-1 after THEY got a player sent off. Also had several games where there have been 7 bookings in a game and sending's off between both teams and I am not even set to 'get stuck in'Anyhow the tactical familarity of my team is great the morale is great squad is incredibly talented I have 3 different tactics to choose from some tweaked and newer than others because as we all know the AI learns your tactics after 8/10 games.I am someone who has been playing these games probably for the best part of 25 years so i know my stuff but because of poor decisions on SI's part the game play and match engine is both boring and unresponsive.I was hoping the full release would remedy this but it is clearly an issue they have given no thought to at all.I just wish I had not spent Â£35 quid and put so much time into this already because as it stands I will now wait until Xmas before I play the game again in vain hope that they update the match engine and game play in a further patch.

1100600,2,0,7.65612E+16,154,4,1,51.3,"19 November, 2019","+ The game aims for high realism! Man U, (yes I know I'm not writing it right, but I do it on purpose) is in the bottom and fighting for survival in the PL with over 1billion spent every transferwindow. Arsenal are in the middle of the table, Everton is relegated, Leeds coming out of the Championship, Barcelona vacuuming the best players from Liverpool ... I don't know what could have been more realistic with the game.+ New features work optimally and are easy to understand.- If you play a match and have 40 shots, 28 on goal and no one is in, you will be incredibly frustrated.- That Liverpool do not sell any players in a transitional window, but can still buy Dybala, De Vrij, Ziyech and Van De Beek, is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. so incredibly unlikely transfer windows! I have played fm from 2009, before that I have played CM from 2001 (?).I have now spent almost 40 hours in the beta, most bugs have been wiped away, the new features that have been added work optimally and I like them very well.the only thing that I'm still not happy with is;- realism of the transitional windows- poor graphics engine during matches- limited options to customize the manager you create- That you have to tamper with files on the data to name Juventus, Champions leauge and Premier Leauge- That logos have to be downloaded in order to be decent, this also applies to the team kits.- Portrait photo for players, should as of today be mandatory.Don't buy it on sale, it's worth every penny."

The game runs and the core elements work, though several things do not. Those several things are what makes a person upgrade from the previous iteration. People pay for the new instalment under the impression that it will be better than the previous...an improvement. Unfortunately, as of the release date which happens to be today, the game have several things yet to be fixed which sadly ruin the immersion of the gaming experience. Every time I face one of these bugs, I understandably become frustrated and lose interest. I understand that the bugs will be ironed out over the coming weeks, though until then I cannot recommend 2020 over 2019.UPDATE: Updates have improved the game and its stability, though several features have gone overlooked despite several mentions within the game forum. Features that were highlighted during the release of the game remain broken and neglected. For a game that is released every year with few major upgrades, it is surprising that so many bugs should exist."

And this year, it got even better! It also helps that this really feeds into my OCD and the management aspect of football is lacking in the other 2 major football games (FIFA and PES). I was playing the Demo for most part of the year (too expensive) before buying the full version recently (on sale). Short summary:Pros:Very deep and informative systemAll inclusive in terms of various aspects of the sportRefined Match Engine (compared to previous titles)Scores of options to start your journey (I always start out unemployed)Widest collection of clubs and countries and national teamsA huge community online to keep engagementConsLack of licenses (easily fixable with mods)Sometimes different features of the games can be too difficult to understandAlmost too in-depth sometimes to have fun playing (I haven't experienced this but many people I know have)The game can be brutally unforgiving at timesAnd that's my short review!

1100600,23,2,mysticalbeans,54,1,-1,325.5,"17 November, 2019","UPDATE--played another 84 hours. I feel like this game is much more scripted than past games. I played as Arsenal and am 2nd in the EPL now. FA Cup comes around, and I have tried, I kid you not, 11 times to beat a League 2 team. Every single time, a different player gets a red card and I lose by at least one goal. I still lose even if I try to take a vacation and sim. This is about par for the course too. I've had Lewandowski line up next to Laca, and watch him receive a pass two meters in from the penalty spot, but hit the shot so poorly that it goes out for a THROW IN. That's nearly impossible. I convert 1 on 1 opportunities at maybe a 10-15% rate, and I had 37 shots on target against Ipswich Town but lost 2-1 because their keeper had over 30 saves. Something is really broken in the mechanics around shooting (and making the easy pass on a 2 on 1 instead of shooting it into the side netting) that makes the games within the game unplayable until fixed.--------------------------------------------------------------------I rarely leave reviews, but I feel like it's important to for this game. I've played these games since Championship Manager 2004 I believe, so I've spent thousands of hours (yikes) not just on Steam.First of all, the match engine is broken. Shattered. Useless.I've had more games than I can count with over 25 shots on target and haven't scored a goal, I've tried every tactic in the world to try to get touches to my Trequartista but can't get the ball to him, I score the majority of my goals from outside of the box even tho I almost always use ""Work Ball into the Box"" (I try to mainly play an Arsenal Tiki Taka), but most frustratingly of all are 1v1s.1v1s are pointless. I've scored exactly one in more than a whole season of play, regardless if the finishing is 12 or 19--mind you, a lot of these goalies were **** from Sky Bet Championship in cup play too. I've yet to see them make an extra pass inside the box to score a goalie (again, think Arsenal) even when I've had a 4 to 1 break (he shot it from outside the box). It's unbelievable how hard it is to score a normal close goal. Want to win? Figure out a solid defensive structure, counter, and fire away from 30m because you're better off with that than 2 forwards and an AMC against a goalie. The UI is solid and the visuals are fine, nothing too exciting, but the board is ruthless. I signed Vignato who scored 18 goals and 15 assists in his first season, and was considered a decent price, but I still got a B on the signing. No explanation why. In all honesty, if I hadn't pre-ordered, I would ask for my money back on this game and wait until next year. I'd just get an updated roster for FM 2017, which I think has the most balanced match engine of all the recent games, because I want to try to emulate football management, and this game resembles very little the game I love."

But, these were all small problems. The game ran smoothly.

I like how the Beginning is easier to understand, especially if you're a newbie.  They take a lot of time in explaining the new features for us veterans and does a good job of refreshing your memory if you haven't played since FM16.  Things have changed a lot since then I would say and all for the Better.  If you have FM19 i'd maybe wait until next years version, but if you're like me and only have FM18 then I would say that FM20 is a definite upgrade and a definite buy.

Unfortunately this series has fallen into the same yearly update cycle that FIFA has -- making slight modifications/tweaks to the engine + updated roster and selling it as a whole new game at full price.

Once again you can feel the joy of blisters forming on your fingers as you smash that space bar to prompt the game forward as it constantly stops for no real reason multiple times per in game day!  And take your joy to a whole new level in the press conferences as we bring you THE EXACT SAME questions from years gone by, but with the bonus of new questions that make no sense!  Experience the joy of answering the same questions each and every in game week in multiple weekly press conferences.  And don't worry, you still have to do them because your assistant manager will just upset your players if you leave it to him!  Speaking of upset players, they're still here, still moaning, still wanting new contracts in the first year of new contracts and still getting upset about anything and everything just because!  And speaking of inept staff, your chief scout wont even assign someone to watch the next opposition even if he's highly rated and experienced!I've put a lot of time in to this year and last year.  The core is somewhere buried amongst all the utter tosh the devs throw in every year, but it's getting harder and harder to enjoy.  SI Games seems to have forgotten that people play games to escape the tedium of life and work, not to experience someone else's.  Having multiple press conferences every week with the same quesitons over and over and over and over and over and over is utterly soul destroying, having players whinge constantly is just annoying and does anyone know the point of the judging skills with scouts because the highly skilled and low skilled seem to rate guys the same.I'll play this, I'll enjoy team building, tactics, transfers and developing young players, but all of that will be severely tarnished by all the add on crap that doesn't need to be there.  And the worst of it is, with the press conferences, this wouldn't be so bad if it was just 2-3 questions once a week.  I wish someone at SI would ask ""does it make it more fun"" once in a while."

Home advantage is ridiculous, when you are playing as the away team, you can never score even if you have more than 15 shots and over half of them are on target. On the other hand, the home team scored as soon as they have 1 or 2 shots on target.2. Players are still doing insane and unreasonable actions, e.g. clearing the ball to my own end line when they got the ball near mid-field. This issue persisted for at least 5 years in this franchise.3. Players always use header to knock the ball to opponent players even if there is absolutely no threat around him.4. You can hardly score from 1 on 1 chances, this is very unrealistic, and persisted many years as well.I recommend against buying Football Manager 2020 at least at this stage unless match simulation has significant improvements."

That's the Football Manager franchise.Again, this is another 'evolutionary' update with even less in it than usual. You have a data update for the new season, and a few things moved around (player development mostly). The player portraits still look like a police photo-fit of someone they'd like to help them with their enquiries, the match engine is slightly less crap, and the game runs a couple of percent faster with a full database of players.And that's it... really.Not worth the release price at all, fair price would be at least half for what is a glorified patch with a data update."

1100600,8,1,7.65612E+16,39,5,-1,814.1,"12 November, 2019","Heres the reality of what I had seen so far on the game and this beta release:The match engine so far is a ABSOLUTE DISGRACE.The main thing about it is players don't adhere to certain tactical instructions at all. They simply don't adhere to instructions like : pass it shorter , shoot less often etc. Players love launching the ball for absolutely no reasons. Centerbacks launch the ball forward to a striker. Play constantly ""switches"" to other flanks about 3495895 times a game. Players loose possesion for no reason without even any pressure on them. Players miss 1v1 chances that are easier to score than miss on a CONSISTENT basis and dont get me wrong when i tested on my test juve save i won league 102 pts and all cups and cl semi  but i had seen this from TOP strikers like higuain etc miss TIME AND TIME AGAIN 1v1 chances however what DOES go in is : long shots , indirect free kicks , free kicks from rediculous ranges etc. The football being played is just rediculous. Often times players can't string a pass when they have obvious passing options they still launch a ball even with individual instructions such as shorter passing ( and i tested with good players.) NOW AS FAR AS GAME IN GENERAL AND NEW FEATURES:The most notable feature in the game is that the board intervenes now when u dont follow certian philosophies such as sing players under 23 for first team etc. They might cancel future transfers u make because u didnt sign or adhere to these philosophies.Theres also now a ""code of conduct"" that automatically disciplines players for various offenses such as missed training , red card etc.And thats about all I saw so far new.The game is roughly the same as last year except now the match engine in the beta at least is piss poor and needs RADICAL changes for the game to be worth playing.HERES A UPDATE:WHEN THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ PATCH 20.2 CAME OUT IT ABSOLUTELY PUT A NAIL IN THE COFFIN OF THIS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ MATCH ENGINE. THE GAME UPON FULL RELEASE BECAME PLAYABLE FOR  A BRIEF PERIOD OF TIME BUT THEN THEY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ KILLED IT WITH THE 20,2 PATCH.

Still no multi-monitor support, no female football, no possibility to create sandbox leagues, etc (the full list is very long actually). New skin (I fiercely dislike new buttons), updated rosters (and no more Juventus license - have fun eliminating ""Zebre"" from random game files), some nice, but still minor, improvements. And, of course, REALLY A LOT of woodwork (if you missed couple  FMs, they even hid woodwork from stats).If you already played FM before, you'll most likely buy it again 'cause there is no competition at all. If not, it's worth trying. With a few clicks, you can control your team better than in scripted simulators like FIFA or PES. There are no major match engine issues this year so the beta is quite playable. Therefore, I recommend it without a doubt and without waiting for a release."

Mine and NPC combined. 50+ Hours played. literally have seen 100s of 1on1 breakaways.My players also seem to ignore ""Shoot Less"" and ""Work Ball Into Box"" and shoot from 30-40 yards out with both instructions.For some reason the dialogue options are confused. I'm in first playing second place - Dialogue option ""The standings currently have us in 4th and our opponents in 1st...""Also not sure how I am expected to finish in the bottom half of the league. I'm undefeated as of January in the Serie C/C in 1st place with a 6 point lead. If I lost literally every game I have left I'd still finish comfortably in 12th.

So even if your team adopts an attacking football, you won't get scored a lot, and meanwhile, your strikers shoot 10 and score 1.I am now playing Arsenal, this team has two good strikers. Lacazette and Aubameyang. Now I am leading PL, and they both don't even score 10 goals in the league ( 28  matches passed)Most of goals came from Xhaka, Guendouzi, David Luiz. Yeah Nicolas Pepe is a good player and he can score. But what about two strikers? They miss 1 on 1 challenge 90%, this is why Auba scores only 8 goals and Lacazette 4. They just boot them to the opposition keeper or goes to over the bar.But here is the point, I adopt long range shooting tactics, therefore, in away match, I won over Tottenham ( 5-1), Man city ( 2-1) Liverpool ( 4-1 )so at this time, all you need is adopting a long range tactics and never expect 1 on 1 challenges as your strikers won't score.

I skipped FM 19 here on Steam but bought FM 19 Touch on the Nintendo Switch.FM 2020 is more of the same with some solid improvements. Certainly compared to 18, the quick tactic creator can be great for newer players who don't quite know what every tactic option does. Pick a template (with helpful in-game descriptions on what exactly the tactics do), tweak it a bit for how your team plays, and you're good to go. The more detail training schedules help out too to really focus your team's weaknessses, rather than forcing you into broad attacking/defense/technical categories.I really think FM 20 is the best starter entry into the series in a long time. Doesn't mean you're guaranteed success or a championship, especially if you start on a top-league team with no experience. But it walks you through the basics of setting up your team even if you don't bother delegating tasks to your coaching staff, and even if you lose, you'll at least have some idea WHY you're losing.Overall an excellent addition to the franchise."

1100600,0,0,7.65612E+16,706,22,1,104.9,"9 November, 2019","TL:DR - Solid release with lots of small and large improvements, however some of the same issues still present.For me this is probably the strongest release in a long time so far. Engine feels slightly improved from last year with only a couple of bugs noticed and some of the common ones from the previous releases fixed.PROSAs well as that they have once again added a new large feature in the player development system, I am yet to get stuck into it however it looks a decent addition with some nice tools for developing your youth teams. They have definitely expanded in this area.As well as the major additions they have refined and sharpened a lot of existing content and features. I really enjoy the expanded staff responsibilities. Allows you to make a lot more use out of your backroom team, I have hired a really strong Head of Youth development in my game and given him permission to find and sign new players for the U18s, however I have kept responsibility for the final say meaning if the players not good enough or in a position thats already saturated I can veto it.There are very minor improvements that only experienced players will likely even notice and even I am finding hard to recall. One example I can say is that when you get promoted from lower leagues in previous game you always go into the next season 500-1 or even 1000-1 to win the league, regardless of signings or how good your team is.This is the first time where the odds actually reflected reality when I went up. My players were really strong and I made big loan signings. We started the season at 16-1 to go up. It felt more realistic.Another example of these minor improvements and refinements was when negotiating deals. In previous titles I found the player demands pre contract were virtually useless. You could just remove them all and the player would still be happy to negotiate, he might just ask for a little more money.Not any more, players will reject negotiations more often if you remove all there demands.There are lots of tweaks and changes like this and they add up to a more immersive and enjoyable game with more problems to solve and elements to manage and balance. May add more of the better ones when I encounter them in my game and am reminded.The overall UI is an improvement for me also, feels clearer and more concise. Easier to navigate.CONSSome of the small main issues and in my opinion the one big problem with FM still exist.Small issues like team shouts being too repetitive and not really dynamic, unrealistic player fallout when a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 4th choice defender is unhappy he isn't starting, teams worse then yours offering you a job every week when your doing well etc. A lot of these still haven't been addressed, though some of them have as I pointed to in my previous section. These didn't make the game unplayable then and don't know.The main issue is still there for me. Once you have mastered the game its too easy and always will be. For experienced players who understand the games tactical and man management systems it becomes far too easy. I am able to take a conference team to the premiership in 5-7 seasons every single game I start without fail. The tactics I play haven't changed since FM2016 really, they were tweaked in the last tactical overhaul but the principle is still the same.I just follow the same tried and tested formula. Its always the same and there isn't really that big a challenge anymore.The game is still fun for me and I enjoy growing my team, discovering new talent, taking my team from the lowest league to the best team in the world and doing big money negotiations etc.But as well as new features and expansions on what is there I long for a new challenge in the games existing mechanics. Maybe a harder mode with some new problems to deal with, or where the existing problems are tougher to deal with or identify. The last few releases have added a lot of identification and prevention tools, I think this was largely down to the community complaining about the game being broken in regards to the match engine, injuries and tactics etc.SI do listen to the fan base and gave a lot of ways to make identification of these complaints easier, as virtually 99% of the time it was the player not managing properly, not an issue with the game.I fear SI will never be able to please everyone in this regard and they have settled on a balance between the two types of players.What we have here is the best football management game there has ever been or will be, every year improvements are made and this year is no different. This may even be the greatest Tycoon / simulation game ever made. 10/10 everytime."

I play with FC Porto, and it's impossible to win the league. SL Benfica always wins it even though I completely destroy them in every match we face each other.My results with them are always 3-0, 4-0 and even 5-0. But what happens is that SL Benfica doesn't lose any points other than the points they lose against me, meaning they always win every single match and finish top of the league with an unrealistic 90+ points.Other than this, in 3 seasons clubs such as Chelsea and Manchester City have become bankrupt?!?Edited: Finished second place in the league one point from first place. At the end of the third season, the day after I won the Portuguese Cup and the last match of the season (second cup won that season) I got told off by the board for failing to win the Cup I had just won (I know right?!?).

I've come across some errors with the in game 3D engine not always matching up with the calls being made (i.e. constant offside calls when in the 3D match engine its clearly onside) but that is probably a beta issue. The 3D engine doesn't appear to be greatly improved graphically, but I've noticed more nuanced movement and animations with the players on the pitch. Player management, particularly squad management has changed somewhat and there are even more ways to classify your players and set training now.You may view this as being more of the same but in my experience that's not always a bad thing with Football Manager."

1100600,0,0,7.65612E+16,47,1,1,524.1,"8 November, 2019","Great improvements already in the beta version - the new features add more depth and allow for players to focus on micromanaging or delegating.In any case, there are a lot of issues to iron out still.- One on ones (as mentioned in a lot of other reviews) are missed at an extraordinary rate.- The fact that there are *so many* one on ones every game also needs review, since it's unrealistic.- Defensive line mechanics don't seem to be working properly, they always allow for strikers to dash behind defenders.- When facing the goal, strikers (or any other player for that matter) always goes for goal and never passes to a better placed teammate, even if the other player is all alone in front of goal and the striker doesn't have a clear angle.- Selecting low or whipped crosses doesn't really change anything.- A few of the club vision criteria are not measured properly. For example, if the club doesn't expect you to sign players over 30, and you sign 8 players of 20 or under, they will still be ""reserving judgment"" even after two years managing the team.- Transfer negotiation between clubs (or contracts with players / agents) need a bit of rework. Negotiations are easily broken for minor reasons.- Conversations with players who are unhappy (want a new contract, etc) should also be reviewed. They sometimes request an improved contract ""just because"", and the conversation itself doesn't always go OK even if you promise to offer a new one.Regardless of the issues stated above, I still strongly recommend it. I trust the issues will be sorted, the game stabilised, and all in all it's a great game.(remember this is still a beta version)"

My team creates so many clear-cut chances, and then goes on to miss like 95% of them! Even though I have really good strikers and inside forwards, and I keep training ""chance conversion"", my team still misses far too many chances for comfort. The AI though, it only needs 1 chance to score 1 goal. It is so frustrating. But overall, I would say the positives far outweigh the negatives, as far as FM20 is concerned. I recommend it."

Wow SI, wow.WORST MATCH ENGINE EVER.Current:Match engine is having some major game killing issues and they seem to be having a problem getting it sorted out. I don't remember a FM release being this wacked out gameplay wise on full release, I'm not feeling confident as several of the issues they have been aware of and after several huge updates (one of them nearly a gig worth) these issues aren't fixed.Inside Forwards and Raumdeuters will not shoot at the goal with their dominate foot, nor will they drive at goal like they should.Everyone should be able to picture the ubiquitous Salah (of Liverpool) goal, where he drives into the box from the right and curls a shot with his left foot.Will not happen once in FM 2020. He gets in the box 1v1 and is not blocked by the defender, but he mostly passes the ball outside the box away from goal, and not to someone with a chance to shoot. Or he turns and drives to the end line or corner of the post and tries to shoot with his weaker foot through the post.This is being reported for other players and teams. They have to have seen these reports, PKMs have been uploaded, but here's the thing SIALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS FIRE UP A GAME YOURSELF AND TRY TO GET THE MOST SINGLE MINDED SHOOTING INSIDE FORWARD IN FOOTBALL TO TRY TO SHOOT WITH HIS LEFT FOOT FROM THE RIGHT.And you will see it is broken.They did fix the fact that no player would ever play a long through ball through the center or over the center.Also you have to play with your defense on narrow defending, but the space is still far too wide when out of possession. You could slide a semi trailer between CBs sideways when set to narrow. I know they spread out often when in possession, but not out of possession.The behavior of the wing backs is not much better, they refuse to cross until they are at the endline, or they pass backwards before then. Cross from deepCross earlyCross more oftenThese mean nothing in FM 2020.I would wait and watch these reviews and check the posts on the Match Engine Bugs thread on Sports Interactive Forums, you can view them without signing up.Early review:THEY FIXED THE ANNOYING REPETITIVE JOKE THAT WAS WINGERS AND FULLBACKS SMASHING CROSSES INTO THE DEFENDERS RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM OVER AND OVER AND OVER.UPDATE UPDATE!!!! Now they have even removed the above! ALL WIDE PLAYERS are back to smashing it into the nearest defender."

FM20 does the best job of any instalment so far of improving and expanding on the good and dealing with the negatives.The match engine is fantastic. Players move in a convincing way; stepovers, Cruyff turns, stop-and-go, all represented here in the best match engine to date. Yes the crowd animations are repetitive but you know what, if you want to play FIFA, go and play FIFA.The IMMENSE scale of the game means you might feel overwhelmed by your responsibilities and the sheer amount of clicking you need to do to establish your latest season but please, friend, worry not! Along with all these new options comes a wealth of new staff responsibilities, and you can delegate or take charge at your leisure, Like to finalise signings but don't really care about the scouting side of things? Delegate it. Prefer to find those hidden gems yourself but couldn't care less about negotiating their contracts? Sure, delegate it. Want to keep an eye on your blossoming U23 side but the U18s are just too far off your radar right now? Guess what? Delegate it.I haven't been this impressed with the advances in a Football Manager title since FM13, everything you can think of that would improve the series from FM19 is here. Data presentation is fantastic, player development and progression is as close to perfection as it could be. FM20 makes the complicated things seem simple and makes the simple things seem effortless. To me, this is now THE Football Manager title. Simply put, FM20 is a defining moment in the history of Football Manager titles. Make no mistake, this one is a classic. Though you may not find the next Tonton Zola Mokouko sitting in Derby County's reserves, every story you do write for yourself on this genre-defining game will carry its own memories and legacy and surely that is the highest praise of all.Ps. Match engine is still sometimes a bit of a joke"

I'll happily admit that I haven't bought a Football Manager game since 2017, due to feeling like nothing was ever really changing. But this time seemed different, and how right I was to make the early investment this time around.As a Football Coach in real life, it's great to see more control over the development of youth players and how the backroom staff can help make or break a player, depending on their own skills as a coach. Before I would pick a lower league side and try to work my way up...it didn't matter what the skill of my players were, we could get promoted every season. But now it feels more realistic, which I love. Destined for relegation? Then you probably will without a decent training set up and well thought through tactics.Choices matter now. Early pre-season is actually important and can effect how your team manages the start of the season...player negotiations are much more realistic too! (Though the constant emails from the scouting meeting can get annoying, when you're not looking to expand).Overall, worth the wait and highly reccommend as the best football management game out there!"

It doesn't matter who the player is, how high their finishing, composure or technique is, 9/10 times they will miss. Shots in 1v1 situations actually end up closer to the corner flag than the goal. Absolute shambles. Players also don't listen to tactics. No point telling your players to put in low crosses because you have small forwards because they never cross low. Most crosses are in the air regardless of instructions. Players can't tackle either. Constantly sliding about and giving away a foul or not coming away with the ball.

I can't comment as a frequent player on the year-to-year transition, but as someone coming back, I can resoundingly say this has been great coming back after I skipped a couple. Let's be honest... we know why we're here. Only the hardiest of souls dare wander into sports management sims, but you're here, and you're ready.For me, having some of the old features feel like an old pair of boots is incredibly welcome. I wandered right back into core mechanics that were familiar, and that was great. Tactics, signing players, match play, etc. Some of the new features are really great and will be underrated/underappreciated at first. Club Vision is very relatable to real world scenarios, and I did new (to me) backroom staff roles.Also, I do not believe it's new, but I absolutely love the Social Group and Team Hierarchy mechanics! Having both personal and team personalities is slick, and recognizable players on a team coalesce or conflict with each other can either bring teams together or rip them apart. Match play seems super solid, and I appreciate that shouts work! I've started with Crewe Alexandra, primarily because as an American traveling through London and Manchester, I always transfer in Crewe (and my real world experience with Arsenal is already traumatic enough).I haven't messed with training, but that's the next goal. ;)All in all, I am simply having fun with FM2020.

Exactly like the year before.This years match engine is full of potential, but not quite there yet. However, thanks to the patch, most annoyances are done and gone. While not as ""fun"" as the ""all out attacking ME"" from last year, this year the ME is more mature and more subtle. More player roles actually play differently and directly influence the gameplay on the field. Finally I can recommend the game for anyone, even those that stayed with FM19 until now. FM20 is, thanks to the new patch, and better all-round football experience than FM19."

FM19's match engine was annoyingly repetitive despite changing tactics, players made the same decisions, stayed in the same position and made odd mistakes that shouldn't be made. So yeah a huge plus point.I actually really like the new youth development tab. As a player that likes to frequently bring through youth players, this makes this style of management so much easier. Whilst earlier games weren't very thorough in keeping track of players out on loan, a quick click can view this.Don't expect any UI changes or match graphics to be improved as these are spitting images of last years games. I don't think the UI is bad, but previous versions were definitely better. Most FM veterans will agree.Delegation of staff responsibilities has been tweaked for the better. I personally prefer my coaches to set opposition instructions and now they'll make these changes for you throughout each match, a big plus point.Although this game is far to similar to FM19, the tweaks and changes that have been made are worth investing into.8/10"

The match engine is laughably bad at this point. And that's not just because the graphics look like absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but because it is super scripted. Sometimes the game seems to tell the match engine ""I need team A to score now"" and then out of nowhere the wildest combination of passes and mistakes happen which lead to a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ goal. You don't feel like you are in charge. So often your defenders just let the enemy run through, so often your goalkeeper makes an obvious mistake and so often your striker just kicks it out of the stadium.Every year they promise an improved match engine but every year it is a letdown. Also almost every year the match engine is broken for the first few months. The only reason I still sometimes play it is because there's no alternative. But once there is a serious competitor I'm off to something else. It's a shame."

There seems to be a very consistent theme of pre-determined bad results, your wingers will always shoot from stupid tight angles, the opposition will always have a one in two, maybe three shot conversion rate, yours will be one in twenty-five, every top player for you will consistently underperform across all tactics/formations.

Few changes here and there however for me personally not too many 'drastic, game changing' feature. i'm and advocate of the development centre feature as i feel it's a huge part of the bringing through to the senior squad. Again not many changes in the actual gameplay part of the game, a few new motions for GK saves and headers from what i've seen but also the unrealistic crossing with back to the goal and a few stupid looking shots still.

Every Ai attack is a simple punt over the top for the striker to chase - regardless of how deep you defensive line is, how little you press, how tight the marking is (or not). Makes no difference - punt finds the striker/winger/full back in acres of space.Another issue is how many times per game you hit the post. 5? 6? Not an uncommon number.Full backs refuse to cross - despite their instructions to do so ""...more frequently"".Your players rarely win headers.The old ""stand there swinging left and right until I'm tackled even though I have an easy pass on"" is still there.SI have had several years to sort out these problems in the ME and each time, the same problems. Makes you wonder exactly what they can justify the Â£35 for - except for a new purple skin of course.Edit. Can't help but also notice how the percentage of injuries have increased since release - and the release of the in-game editor. Furthermore, the Ai will arbitrarily give you a ""bad run of form"" once a season - without fail. Just now, I played around with a game v. Atalanta in the Serie A. Played the game three times and all three resulted in a 0-0 draw despite Atalanta registering 0 shots in the three games. My team registered between 5 and 12 shots on target. As a test, I reloaded and went on holiday giving my assistant instructions to use the same team and instructions I had used in the previous 3 attempts. With the Assistant manager in charge using my tactics and team selection the three results came in as 1-3, 2-3 and 0-3 in my favour. Why would the three results be so different despite using my instructions and team selection when the only difference is that the Ai is in charge on the team?"

Each year SI Games tweaks the game a bit to the better, sometimes with bugs and other new issues that comes along with that. A lot of players almost always ask for a new match-engine that will make the game more realistic. Ive bought this game(series) since before it was called Football Manager but the last year each time felt Im being robbed a bit, as some stuff that comes each year with a ""Brand NEW IMPROVED game"" should be updates or patches or even DLCs. The game is still in BETA you say, dont complain!!, but I wonder if the game ever does come out as it feels like an updated version each year.

(e.g. clicking E to select England easier, not working)- When saving team selections, box that we are writing down the selection name is not activated until clicking on box or pressing tab button on keyboard.

Most of the goals I've scored come from long range efforts, which is super unrealistic. Also, they've removed the ability to fine you player for performing badly.

The new Club vision and development centre parts of the game are fantastic editions to someone like me who likes to play a proper career( Start Unemployed, with no badges yet). The evolution of youth players and the use of an actual vision of what the Club want to do allows for more long term planning and even more immersion into the game. It always takes me many weeks to switch from the previous version of the game to the new one, because starting over( whilst i have 40 or more years of history in a current game) is hard to let go. But i was still intending to play FM2019 for a few more weeks yet (Trying to win the Bundesliga with Freiburg in 2055 after 6 years in the job and last season being pipped by Bayern Munchen on goal difference) but started a game in FM20 just to have a look at the new features and havent returned to the Black forest yet, 20 hours of gametime later, i wonder if i`ll ever return to see if we could get the Meisterschale. 10/10"

I am no longer able to cycle between all formations so I can choose the one I want. They are now locked behind a tactical style, and you have to pick one before you can see formations. Squad selection page is cluttered, and the mid match view is not intuitive in terms of being able to quickly see what the best sub options are for a particular player. You seem to have added multiple views but they each do a separate thing, which is not very efficient.You had a great interface before that was more compact and easier to browse.

So far, so good.Allowing you staff to hire under and reserve team staff is the best time saver feature that's been added.New mental attribute, 'Negotiation' allowing you to leave a DoF in charge with contractual responsibilities is a personal fav.New code of conduct feature is another great addition. Automatic fines for various behaviours.Development centre is a very useful tool.I have an on going issue with the tactics getting more restrictive though. Have roles, but let us have full control of a position also."

But to those who doesnt care too much about the game being new and all that, it really is basically the same as 19 and 18. Really thought this year they were gonna upgrade graphics and game engine etc, but still looks worse than the first fifa. Not expecting fifa graphics, but improvements more than 1 added pixel i really think we deserve more. Been playing FM since it was called CM and this is not impressive at all."

I'll keep playing FM since I already paid, but, thanks to disgusting players and commissioners in sports I will no longer purchase any sports games that are based on real players or teams. Nothing that gives income to spoiled and disgustingly behaved overpaid sports. I have already marked FM2021 as Ignore in Steam and mark all sports based on real life as ignore now."

There are a couple of improvements but honestly, like FIFA you're paying for the updated scouting and teams etc. The engine seems improved and the small details in staff and youth management seems a bit better and easier to both streamline and go into detail which is great but I think most players will barely realize it.I recommend this game because it is the best management game out there. Even if you're not a huge football fan you'd like this great simulation/management game. A keen interest and knowledge of real football of course helps though."

I agree with this, to an extent, as there is nothing more fruitful than being able to connect spiritually and emotionally with the team you support on the football pitch. However, while playing this game, the only thing I can connect with is my fist to the screen because this game is utter nonsense, it is the epitome of crap, it is the personification of a headache. Aight, so listen, hear me out. Why the heck do my players always become prime Mo Salah when they are in the box, they literally need 10 good chances to score 1 goal. Not only that, my players seem to become Raheem Sterling in the sense that not only do they only score tap ins, they also crapping miss tap ins. What the heck. Nah, we can't let us this fly. Not to mention that your team could have 30 shots but lose to a team that have 5 shots. Yeah, that does happen in football sometimes, I ain't disputing that, but this happens literally every 3 games in FM. They should change the abbreviation to ""FML"" at this point, cuz that's how it feels like when I'm playing this game. It's a great game with a lot of potential, but just like my 4 and a half Star Illian Mesiler, that potential was utterly destroyed by the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of the gameplay aspect in this game.

I usually mix between either the full system on PC or the mobile version - usually preferring the mobile as I can play more freely. But I opted for the full version this time around, but it runs super slow on my pc. I guess it's my pc but when I deleted all unnecessary things on it to make it work and still only get 1star performance on the smallest database i just find it too slow and takes forever to get through any loading screens. (I played 32hrs to get to January in 2019, way too long for me!) As well as all the extras that you get in the full game it just takes forever to get anything done.

1100600,0,0,brunofranconetto,136,8,-1,51.2,"20 August, 2020","I've been playing different entries of football manager/championship manager since the late 90s and I've liked some and disliked others. Unfortunately, football manager 2020 will definitely go in the disliked category for me, which is really a shame because there are several things about the game that I did like. The interface is pretty,  lot of the club management features work well and new additions such as the club's vision and the development center are pretty cool and add to the overall experience. The major problem with football manager 2020 however, at least in my experience after having played this years' game for 50+ hours (plus about 20 hours with the demo), is that this year's version is incredibly frustrating and just not that much fun at all. I really wish I could go back in time and not pick up the demo or pay for the full game because overall I feel that I just wasted a great deal of my time, and a little bit of money, and have gotten very little enjoyment in return. In fact, most of my time playing this year's game has been mostly terribly stressful and frustrating. My only save in this year's game, which I started with the demo, was managing Juventus (called Zebre in this year's version since they didn't have the full naming rights for the team). After struggling to win the league in my first year (ended two points ahead of second placed team, AC Milan) I finally had a pretty decent second season winning the league comfortably after bringing in a bunch of new signings such as James Rodriguez, Cavani, David Neres and David Silva. My performance in Europe meanwhile was truly embarrassing, having been eliminated in the group stage in the first season and in the round of last 16 by Lyon in the second season (got killed in the away game 0-3), despite having a pretty great team. However, it was truly in my third season that things got ugly. After signing a number of great players, some young and promising (Fabio Silva, Antony) and others highly skilled and experienced (Aubameyang, Oblak) I started the season by beating Roma 3-1. This was the kind of result that I would have expected and I was happy to start the season with a victory. After that it was all downhill though, getting destroyed by Napoli (1-5 away) in the second game and accumulating a number of bad results after that no matter what I tried to do. This is when I decided enough was enough and uninstalled the game.I understand that winning all the time would not be fun or realistic but it just felt that I was really not having all that much fun at all with this year's game and that overall the game just wasn't fair. The basic team and tactics that had allowed me to comfortably win the league in my second season all of sudden simply didn't work at all and after I started losing there was no stopping the bleeding essentially. Really, no matter what I did I could not get good results or have the team play well, especially away from home, and while I want the game to be realistic I just didn't feel that it was.In FM 2018, the last FM I played before FM 2020, I had enjoyed a tremendously successful run with West Ham, having eventually built up the club to win the Premier League several times and even win the Champions League, and even though away matches had always proved difficult I never had the same degree of underperformance as in this year's game. I really feel that the game is either not fair or it is not telling the players what they should do to correct their mistakes and have their teams perform better. Overall, I would certainly say that I wish I hadn't played this year's game and I really, really hope I don't make the same mistake next year and buy this game, even at a discount. The game requires too much of a time investment in my opinion to ultimately deliver such a frustrating and unfair experience. My advice is stay away from this game or play at your own peril..."

1100600,0,0,7.65612E+16,92,6,-1,183.9,"20 August, 2020","I am reluctantly going to give this a thumbs down. Now, i'm reluctant because i do enjoy the game, as i'm pretty sure anyone who likes football and/or management games would do to some extent. The problem with it is the lack of realism in the matches and results, which has been an issue in previous versions but nowhere near to the same level as in this 2020 version.I will give some examples of what i mean. There have been games where my team has completely outplayed the opposition, i have had over 30 shots on target, over 50 shots in total. The opposition has 2 shots, guess which team wins that game 2-0? That's right, not mine. Throughout these games their 2 star goalkeeper makes absolutely world class and, in many instances, physics breaking saves that would quite literally be impossible in real life. Meanwhile my 4.5 star at this point best in the game goalkeeper can't even catch a ball. The goals the opposing team scores are almost always shots that should be saved with ease. I have seen the opposition keeper save a shot that is hit from 2 yards, as hard as it can be and right in the corner yet somehow their keeper saves it. As i said, physics breaking and completely unrealistic.Now this has been a problem that has come up in previous version of the game, but before it would happen in maybe 2 or 3 games a season, which i guess was supposed to represent that on very rare occasions you may get a game like that. In this 2020 version this seems to happen almost every other game. It completely spoils the realism and immersion of the game when you beat a title rival 5-1 then the next week lose 1-0 to the team which is bottom of the league even though you have 25 shots on target compared to their 1 shot. So, this is why i am reluctantly giving this years version a thumbs down. I enjoy it, you will probably enjoy it, but the complete lack of realism is very jarring and very frustrating. Especially so when they like to advertise themselves as being the most realistic manager sim out there. If i were you i would do yourself a favour and buy the 2018 version, update the player lists with mods. That's the best version of the game in the last 5 years."

Fundamental problem is the match engine. Players dwelling on the ball, losing possession in their own half and conceding a goal. Players absolutely failing to score 1v1. There is also a massive lack of consistency to performances. EG - I have had 70+ percent possession and only registered 1 shot on target with Work Ball into the Box. As a test - I ran the same fixture approximately 10 times, using different formations, line-ups, tactics, so on. A team about 4 places and 6 points below me in the league, who we beat 3-0 previous fixture. Every single time we lost by at least one goal. Don't but it.

For me everything looked reallistic based on match stats.The only thing im disliking since 17 (i think) is this role thing where you cant not give some combinated instructions just because the game dont want you to do. In real life, some players create roles, not just follow specific ones, if it wasnt the case, the programmers were not adding new roles each edition, they could keep it, and add an option where you can create a role for a position."

You always need to do better than last year in order to please the board. Also the board always forces you to play certain playing style, which you can't negotiate even with godlike determination skill. Also the interface is disabled to change the level of importance to certain requirements.Player training is fake, players have baked in attributes that you ""unlock"" via training, but you can NEVER train something that you think the player would actually benefit from.Absolutely retarded training system.Match instruction options are far few and uncreative and repetitive.UI has so many glitches all over the place, for example setting up set piece takers is ultimately bogus.You can opt to have your assistant manager to handle the ultimately boring and repetitive and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ stupid interview questions, but it will obliterate your media handling reputation, reducing your chances to get another job.If your team fail to produce results, it is career ending, don't expect any job offers, regardless of your legendary manager skills, your reputation is irreversibly annihilated.Old players skyrocket into being useless at a much faster rate than in reality. It is laughable how all football manager game predicted Christiano Ronaldo to deteriorate hungarian division 3 level. And guess what, yet he is still playing for Juventus, how come dudes? To make it even worse, in this game they will NEVER accept lower salary. Even if they play at the level of a 2nd world war veteran at the age of 110, they will ask more than in their prime years. Rendering all old players not just a big gamble, but an expensive money waste.Game loading is disabled during a match. Making save scumming the most annoying experience in this game.At least it's realistic that all the English leagues are full of useless overpriced crap! At least you don't need much brains to do well on the transfer market. Avoid English players like the plague and you will do just fine.Btw transfer market expectations of the board is also ridiculous. When you want to meet league criteria, you need to buy players from your own nation. But they are limited. All the clubs are fighting for them, driving up their price. Especially the good ones. When you sign players that play international level, you will always hear the board whine about their price. Even though you kind of assembled the best team within your nation, they will crybaby about it. Ridiculous.Then the transfer revenue percentage. Every now and then they will reduce your transfer revenue percentage, just because why not. Although it takes just about asking them to raise it back - to make it completely retarded.Oh, god no, the coaches. There are so few that are actually good. Coach training is completely useless. You can't realistically max out your coaches.Also improving your training facilities. Takes tens of years. You can bump it once every year. And you can only afford that if you won every match that is physically possible with your dudes - and it takes all your revenue. Tell Ronaldinho that it takes billions of dollars and tens of years to get a proper training facility together. They can't just kick the rubber in a courtyard, cos that way they will never have the ""potential"". So freakin dumb mechanic.Sponsors are nearly non-existent. Even if you massively over-perform and somehow cheat yourself to win the Champions league with a lower division team. You will still only have the 100$ yearly backing of the local grocery store. Maybe you will get an extra 30$ offer from the local fake KFC clone.If you manage to improve your team, you will end up having all the old â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ players whine about playing time - even if they regularly play in your B team against opponents that they used to fight against. No they complain, that they want to play against Liverpool with their one and a half star rating.Youth. Omygod! You can have godlike coaches, if you have your youth facilities too low, you will always end up getting complete garbage players.Additional training focus is just a joke. A player with a skill of 5 on penalties can't improve it. Just forget it. Even though if Ronaldo and Messi are mentoring him together. I guess a cripple in a wheelchair has better prospect to be a professional fotballer in reality than your youth players in this game.Custom team actually doesn't fully give you the freedom. And you can't delete your custom players, so if you made a mistake and create the same player slightly modified, it will have a clone.Also the original modified team's members will be available on a free transfer. For example if you sack the Barca, you will have all the top players available for free and suddenly Manchester United will buy all of them, good luck winning champions league with your custom team after that!There is no easy to understand guide how you should set your team to succeed. Trial and error is completely useless cos of extreme RNG.From all the above, the predetermined player skills are the most annoying as this mechanic completely takes out the long term strategy of football. Why would you adopt a certain training if the players have LOCKED-IN skills that never react to any kind of training, even with godlike coaches and godlike training equipment and quadruple training intensity, they will simply say: No effect.So all it remains is a transfer market game. Buy the players with the skills already in place. Because you can't train them as you like.Overall the game is extremely restrictive. Slow paced and annoying experience. Overpriced garbage, with terrible graphics and over-complex UI for the average user."

One minute your GK saves amazing goals - the next minute, he doesn't know what the ball is doing.- Broken stat/attribute systems that don't really make any sense.- Your tactics are probably fine - the game is dumb.- The computer switches tactics far faster than a human player or manager ever could. This should be fixed.- Win 20 games in a row? Doesn't matter - the next game your guys will forget how to pass out of the back, always head balls to opponents, and struggle.- Win championships? Your players will still act shocked when you tell them they are capable of beating Manchester United in the Carabao Cup final, and then you go and do it, and then next time, they still act shocked when you suggest they are capable of winning it all. So dumb.- Go unbeaten in a season and then play like they hardly know each other in a game against a tougher opponent. Seriously, fix this!In other words, don't buy this game until it is cheap, cheap, cheap."

I still remember when i was having my press conference speech in the kitchen while preparing my coffee or my sleepless nights because of a title game in the next day. but i never thought one day i would mark this game as 'not recommended'.For my humble opinion, this game was still ok until 2017 release, where i was not suffocated with too many, but really too many details, which kill the enjoyment of the game. if i really wanted to become a football manager in real life, i would do what is necessary for it. but wait: this is just a 'GAME'. This ,(at least) 'WAS' a game when there were 'acceptable amount' of details. This was a game when there were 'acceptable amount' of challenges,which were still pushing me to use my brain. It now turned out an algebraic calculus where i should take all the tiny hells into consideration. I am sure some people would now say: This is the realism. Really? Are you guys sure Football is something like this? Are you guys  seriously sure that any of the managers in real life calculate the effect of 'intuition' or 'determination of a backup left wing on the pitch? where is your passion guys? who cares about the match engine?

The board of directors are pricks giving you no funds and expecting you to get Reading mid table.

The negative review is because there is little effort put into the series, FM has been little more than a roster update with minor tweaks. Just compare it to out of the park baseball which completely blows it out of the water. In comparison this looks like a budget title but it isn't. About the only things FM does better is scouting and the 3D looks better. It's getting a little boring that there's never any real additions.Ootp has you start at any time with the rosters and rules of that time with the players emerging and rules been added as time goes on. Customise the rules. Create new leagues with new teams easily with an easy way to give them logos and jerseys. Adding custom jerseys and logos is much easier in general you could easily change them out every year if you wanted. Put players of every era in so for example want pele and zidane in 2020 go ahead. Feel you can have a much bigger impact on the match with tactics and choices though this is partly because baseball is easier to do that for than football. A match engine that makes sense and works. It runs considerably faster and better they also call their skip a skip instead of a holiday. Even something as minor as the facegen is better. What have we gotten in FM? Tweets and press interviews :).I'd like them to add something major for once but have a feeling this review will probably be as relevant to FM 2025 and 2030 as this one :/."

The match engine feels like it's been programmed by people who have never seen a game of football in their lives, the tactical options are full of annoying arbitrary details (sorry, your midfielder is a 'mezzala' not a 'carrilero' so they can't effectively do what you want them to do) that make it feel more like a series of traps you have to navigate rather than a way to help you get your players to do what you want.  Which they won't, by the way.  For the quintessential FM2020 experience, just ask your team to 'work the ball into the box' and watch them pass it sideways back and forth until the entire opposition team is behind the ball, and then either stand still shuddering on the spot like a pensioner having a stroke until they get dispossessed, or give up and smack the ball against the nearest defender.  If you try to play attacking football, you get beaten by long balls over and over.  Try to defend and watch 25 yard worldies repeatedly scream into the corner of your net.Devs, if your thinking was that it was too easy to pick any team and conquer the world with them - yes, it was.  That was the point.  That was the fun.  Please lose the traps and bring back the fun."

There is a lot more new stuff and better graphics added to the system, and many more clubs to enjoy.The biggest issue I have is there is bunch of LGBT flags almost on every stadium including Turkish and Russian clubs but also when you do other matches in non-registered teams like Middle East, makes 0 sense to have LGBT on Saudi Arabia, and it feels like Devs are promoting so much to spread political values on a football game. I have no issue seeing LGBT flag on Western clubs, but seeing these on Turkish or Russian teams or in Africa, Asia or Middle East makes 0 sense and a perfect example of 1st World Liberalism forcing values on 3rd World countries, and acting like they are inferior or barbarians.Without the forced Western Liberal values on other countries it is a good game, but I hope Devs will either respect local cultures more or make more realistic scenarios when it comes to these politics. After all we had a World Cup on Russia and soon on Qatar and FIFA did not care much except the money part."

You have the grand strategy element of heaps and heaps of numbers going up and down and the initial confusion of understanding what any of them mean, as well as being able to play for 400 hours (like I have) and realise you understand absolutely nothing about the game, and still having that creeping feeling that you really don't know what you're doing.The RPG element comes from your players. Each of your players has their own wants and needs, and you have to balance your match day squad as best as possible. It's not just a case of ""who's best at what"" (although sometimes it can be) - you might need to settle a disgruntled player, or give one of your younger players a chance to shine and get some experience in the first team.It's hard to show what the appeal of the FM series is unless you really sink your teeth into it. I can honestly say I get ridiculously immersed in this game. You experience the highs and lows of your labour, cringing when your team has an awful defeat and cheering when they do well. Were you responsible? Was it just RNG? Who knows, but it's fun, isn't it? Trying to work out what's actually you and what is just smoke and mirrors is part of the fun.What I'm trying to say is, even if you're not a fan of football and sport, if you have an interest in grand strategy or complex RPGs you may just appreciate the incredibly diverse and immersive game that has the potential to grab you here. For me, players like Alessandro Rossi, Hendrick Weydandt and Luismi are burned into my brain, and I've gotten a brand new appreciation for the complexity and nuance that the sport of football has. This IS the beautiful game, but not as you know it."

Screaming at my screen for the defenders to mark their man (ya know, ""use tighter markings"") and stop leaving gaps and giving them so much space to move the ball. Instead they stand there, don't defend, don't cover, just watch the striker dribble past and take an open shot at goal.Fine, maybe my team will dribble past when its our turn at ball.Wait... No?

All season without bad injuries and suddenly you can't play with ur prefer players. Right now, I'm playing with SL Benfica and going to play against Arsenal in the Quarter-finals of the Champions League, and I get FIVE players injuries in the last two weeks: 4 of them are players from my starting team, including mine goalkeeper! Arsenal has zero injuries. I don't know how this can be called ""realistic"". For FM2020, playing with a Portuguese team against Mahrez, Ozil, Aubameyang, and Lacazete it's not enough, they need injurie half of your team...! What a j-o-k-e.If you are comfortable in your national league (1st) and you want to make a good CL, this can be a lost season. Saying in another way, losing my precious time. You can say all these injuries it's ""bad luck"", but we all know it's not. This happens frequently in the biggest season games. It's basically the IA being biased in a very silly way and calling you retarded...

A match engine with a seemingly endless ability to frustrate you with flaws, 'player errors' and comical graphics. A transfer system that is skewed heavily in favour of the AI. A manager 'rating system' that bears no resemblance to a managers performance as well as the inability to alter club beliefs. All of which SI has been aware of in previous versions but, it seems, would rather focus their efforts on Regen personal circumstances and their own interpretation of Brexit. Sports Interactive have learned from FIFA, in all the worst ways. Churn out a game that is marginally different to the previous one (with bugs that subsequently require multiple versions to correct for the next 6 months), charge full price... voila. TL;DR - stick to FM14/15."

The game is too slow, over-complicated and lacks the pace and addictiveness of previous versions. I stopped buying after FM2015, because FM2014 was so bad I feared they had gone back in that direction... they have. All the bad stuff put back in. I am off to find an external boot drive so I can go back to playing FM2015. Maybe spend more time on making a fun, enjoyable game and less time on the stupid avatar thing which is useless.

It's a game you love to hate, hate to love, love to love and hate to hate at the very same time. I am pretty familliar with football as a sports, but I wouldn't call myself exactly a fanatic. But this game (and serial in general) is something I can't let go out of my hands. It does have that certain level of simulation value, where you can see what could happen, how would something look in certain conditions and it does always make sense.Not only that, but it's the only game in this world which brings me to the very top and the very next game slams me down right into the ground. To a non-FM player it's pretty hard to explain how it feels when your regional club manages to snatch a draw against a club like Real Madrid in Champions League only to suffer a humbling defeat against a last placed club in your domestic league the very next game. And it's like a d*ug, you just can't let it go. When it goes good, you can't drop the game because you are on a roll, when it's bad you can't drop the game because you're not just some sissy that's giving up when times get rough.This game can really drive you insane.

You can see that the creators have tried to add more and more content to make it as absorbing and immersive as possible. Unfortunately it's let down by being structurally broken for one simple reason. The tactics and match engine are appalling. It takes away from everything else, as you feel you can't link what you have instructed the team to do vs what they are doing, and more importantly, what the opposition do. If you press, they half-arse it, the opposition dance round you and score. If you sit back, the opposition pass round you and score. Your players can't or seemingly choose not to tackle, meaning the opposition will literally run by your defenders like they're not there whilst your player stands still and lets them by. Your team cannot mark an opposition player in any situation and do not win any defensive second ballsThis would actually all be forgivable if the opposition suffered the same flaws as you. However, this is FM so they don't. If you decide to get everyone behind the ball because you're fed up of watching your team not even try to defend, then whoever you're playing will score multiple 25 yard strikes to the top corner - with no correlation to their long shots and technique stats. If you try and engage in any way, well whoever has the ball becomes Messi incarnate and will happily run past multiple defenders to score  - again, with no correlation to their dribbling and finishing. I won't mention your team's inability to finish clear and half chances vs the opposition for my own sanityThe game strikes me as the latest window dressing in a series that needs a fundamental overhaul"

With some tweaks and small improvements (which really weren't necessary since the game was already great), the game has surprisingly gotten even better.

However, I don't like how they've made this game more difficult over the years and also taken away the unrealistic stuff that you can take advantage of, wheres kept the unrealistic stuff that make the game difficult.For example, youth intake is different, something you can't take advantage of (unrealistic stuff taken away that can be taken advantage of).Another example, your players moaning about not having enough players in the squad and giving me only 7 days to make transfers. You can't do that in 7 days, so what happens is you have an unhappy player.Another example, players in english non-league, who are free signing wanting over 20k per week. WTF is with that? I have the media chats, they've been the same for years now. It's boring.Also a lack of flexibility when talking to players about problems, they won't accept 9/10 of the stuff that you say and then get an unhappy player.Previous years I have enjoyed, however this I haven't. I didn't mind the unrealistic stuff, but the game is unbalanced in the way, where the unrealistic stuff that make the game difficult, don't change, but the exploits do. If your going to be a fair game, then take all this crap out, not just some of it.I think I will be leaving for game for a few years, hoping they iron out some of these elements that make the game less realistic, which make the game more difficult to play."

FM20 does the best job of any instalment so far of improving and expanding on the good and dealing with the negatives.The match engine is fantastic. Players move in a convincing way; stepovers, Cruyff turns, stop-and-go, all represented here in the best match engine to date. Yes the crowd animations are repetitive but you know what, if you want to play FIFA, go and play FIFA.The IMMENSE scale of the game means you might feel overwhelmed by your responsibilities and the sheer amount of clicking you need to do to establish your latest season but please, friend, worry not! Along with all these new options comes a wealth of new staff responsibilities, and you can delegate or take charge at your leisure, Like to finalise signings but don't really care about the scouting side of things? Delegate it. Prefer to find those hidden gems yourself but couldn't care less about negotiating their contracts? Sure, delegate it. Want to keep an eye on your blossoming U23 side but the U18s are just too far off your radar right now? Guess what? Delegate it.I haven't been this impressed with the advances in a Football Manager title since FM13, everything you can think of that would improve the series from FM19 is here. Data presentation is fantastic, player development and progression is as close to perfection as it could be. FM20 makes the complicated things seem simple and makes the simple things seem effortless. To me, this is now THE Football Manager title.Simply put, FM20 is a defining moment in the history of Football Manager titles. Make no mistake, this one is a classic. Though you may not find the next Tonton Zola Mokouko sitting in Derby County's reserves, every story you do write for yourself on this genre-defining game will carry its own memories and legacy and surely that is the highest praise of all.Ps. Match engine is still sometimes a bit of a joke"

FM 19 was an attempt to overhaul tactical side of the game and quite expectedly many changes didn't go too well, resulting in inconsistent Match Engine, where player simply can't see results of his choices, because intructions fail to apply. It was understandable and I hoped these issues would be fixed next year. They were not, in fact they got even worse.Completely unrealistic chance coversions, GKs never following instructions, wingers mindlessly hitting balls when there are two open teammates in the box, nerfed strikers, passive counter mentality, you name it. Adding this to already existing problems like neverchanging interviews, interactions with useless options, unbalanced transfer market, stale world simulation and overestimated reputation effect, and you get the clear sign that SI have stopped paying attention to players feedback. We don't really need loan manager or any other fancy roles, when DoF is still useless, here's your exampleNow don't get me wrong, I'm still a fan and FM is my favourite addiction, but I see 19 as a failed step forward and 20 is worse than 19. I'll keep playing, but I'm concerned that series are going backwards, and devs are applying cosmetic changes to a stale team management, in the meantime messing up match engine more and more. Eventually this might hurt themCutting to the chase, if you pick top club and apply plug and play tactics, you'l have a blast and win things. If your FM experience is playing for underdogs, developing club and tinkering with tactics and scouting, you might be up for a frustrating experience"

But its not change much compare to the last, if you jump from FM15 or FM16, it will be a whole new experience. But from FM18 and 19, not so much.Good:- Youth Academy is a good add on. I think they should make it long time ago not until 2020.- Staff is now very active and lively. Head of youth development is actively seek and buy youth prospect at a bargain price. The old version just splash lots of cash, pay overprice for a youth player.- Match Engine: a little more realistic, speed, strength and balance actually show clearly in the match. You will see the clearly different between a fast and slow player, an outpace or a successful dribble is satisfying to watch, also there is fake turn where the attacker trick the defender by dribbling in the opposite direction. A strong and good player will still standing and not lose the ball even taken 2-3 successful tackle from opponent.- I haven't seen any weird angle shot yet like many players report.Cons:- Match Engine: yep, still ME, I gonna break down each situation below.In 2019 ME, when ST receive ball in the middle, he will dribble and usually lose the ball or try to pass to the wing and slowly run to the enemy third. Its usually not end up in a goal.2020 ME, ST receive the ball with a beautiful touch and turn on Saiyan mod. Dribble through both the defenders and 1v1 with the goalkeeper.And talk about the 1v1, what seperate it from real life is i never seen an attacker that lob the ball, dribble around the keeper  or nutmeg. Just a boring hopeful shot.- Player's value: I have a feeling that the value of player is higher than previous years, some player with very normal stats, sure he have potential but no way that guy price is 30~40 mil. In FM19 my player would be very good and it take a top performance season to reach 20 30 mil."

Understood that away days would generally be more difficult than home games however making bottom of the league teams level contenders with top of the league teams in terms of possession and chances is too unrealistic. The new addition of random goals being scored out of absolutely nowhere with no build up has on occasion made me want to smash my computer, this isn't necessary and adds nothing positive to the game.Can honestly say that in the past ten games played, opposition GK have had unrealistically good performances. Expected on the odd game but not every game.The better your team gets, the harder the game makes it which is great as it continues making the game challenging however, is also unrealistic in ways of world class strikers going from scoring 40 goals a season to not being able to put the ball past a bottom of the league keeper.The game is highly addictive but unfortunately, there are more negatives to the gameplay than positives. The majority of the above have always been the case with fm games but with FM20 it is clear that these negatives have become a bigger part of the game."

1100600,1,0,7.65612E+16,87,16,1,252.1,"2 July, 2020","I used to buy FM every year since CM93.  Nowadays I only buy FM every other year because of the minor improvements and I always wait for the summer sale, not because I'm tight but because most of the problems have been ironed out by then.  This year, as always, there is a new look and feel to FM, it has taken me about 40 hours to get used to it but I have to say, I like it, it feels more immersive, you feel closer to your players with better interactions than previous versions, they've actually put some new text choices in to things like the ""Press Conference"" amongst other things and I'd say its about time too.The thing that really immerses me in the game is the 3D Match Engine, for me, its the part where you get to see all your hard work pay off (or fail) and unfortunately, there isn't much of an improvement in that regard.  Its ok, as it was last year and the year before but it could really do with being better quality than it is.  Don't get me wrong here, I love FM20 but you would think that 3-4 years down the line, it might actually look a bit more improved than it is.The other thing that irks me, and I'm sure, many others is that on release, FM always has many problems, bugs, errors etc..  They have a whole year to get it right, why do they release a game at +Â£40 and then take 6 months to make it playable?  It makes people mad every year, with the money they suck out of us each year, you'd think that SEGA/FM would offer a more polished product on release.  I'd happily pay full price every year if there were improvements that worked out of the box.That said, I'm happy with my Â£20 purchase and I like the new layout, FM20 is a good game (now) and well worth the price, it'll give any football fan many hours of replayable headaches and nightmares, just like real football."

I also feel that the tactics screen and sliders and so-forth are less impactful on play than they perhaps have been in FM generations past, but that may be because the interface changes just don't sit well with me.  So much of this game feels like changing a winning formula not for the sake of change, but to try to attract new players to the game as if a slightly more modern tactics screen and a less functional scouting page would entice new people to play a very autistic spreadsheet simulator game.  The only reason I don't regret my money spent per se is that now seeing my investment in this game as a waste of money, I've begun to move on from these infinite-replayability games that don't accomplish anything but suck away precious time in my life from doing things that are actually enriching or enjoyable.

To add to this problem, big clubs will forever be breaking the transfer record, yet when they go in for one of your superstars, they will offer laughable non-negotiable offers barely above the players market value.Sports Interactive are unfortunately going from one of the few good games developers to another run-of-the-mill developer not taking into account the comments of their fans, using Football Manager as a cash cow.

1100600,1,1,mrscorpioxx,13,2,1,50.2,"28 June, 2020",The game has come from so far and i love where it has gotten to at this point. The gameplay is perfect. Definately its best for single player but has a multiple coaches option that still works perfectly even tho not many play it. The online kinda lags a lot but i do not know if that is my pc or internet but thats my only issue. I have never experienced any bugs since 2019 and believe the future for this game is getting brighter with every year. The content is just amazing. Not too overwhelming and not to little. This game makes even non gamer football fans actually enjoy to play the game.

1100600,1,0,7.65612E+16,50,7,-1,429.2,"27 June, 2020","What can I say about this game, I have such mixed feelings about this.First off, this might arguably be the best FM in terms of all the control and freedom it provides to you, with a slightly better UI and performance. However the thing that really goes against the game is the match engine, which is, well, horrendous to put it mildly. It has been getting worse over the past few years but, this might just be the worse one. I really don't know what I can add that hasn't already been covered in countless other reviews.I love FM, I've played like 10 different editions of this game, but if you have FM 19, or even 18, I wont recommend buying this game. Rather download editor data and update transfers than buying this game.  Hopefully Sega listens to the community and fixes the game engine next year because this has been going on for 2-3 editions now."

I see a lot of improvment form FM2014 and its great. Great game and good improvments from my last memories of FM2014.

1100600,0,0,7.65612E+16,92,24,1,28.7,"25 June, 2020","I bought this game in the sale and it is a worthwhile purchase. I generally buy Football Manager games every 3-4 years because sometimes they are not so different. I am coming up from FM 2017.The best thing about this game is that the graphics are a little better when playing a match. Player animations are clearer and the ball really curves now when shots are taken. Nothing major but it does make for a better playing experience. I also like the addition of the Video Assistant Referee. Obviously, the game has updated players and this is another big advantage when you want to use players that are at your club now (especially if your team in real-life has improved!). The interface is quite loud and a bit confusing for me. I preferred FM 2017 because it was simpler and cleaner. However, you do get used to it and over time it becomes easier to find out where things are and how to adjust settings. I recommend increasing the text size.The gameplay has also been updated to include 'gegenpressing' and other tactics. It just makes an already good game better and it is worth getting it in the sale! 8/10.*For FM 2021, I would like to see goal-line technology and VAR replays shown on your screen."
1100600,0,0,7.65612E+16,38,1,1,434.9,"25 June, 2020",I play a lot of games but have never wrote a review. I'm really loving this version of Football Manager. I also own FM 2014. The game has come quite a way since then. I really love games that give me the control to build and manage all aspects of a team. FM 2020 gives me everything I need. I'm currently playing this over another game I really enjoy (The Division 2). I just get so much enjoyment for what I look for in games. Hope this helps then next person make their decision. Cheers!

You learn so much about the sport on all fronts: the different roles of the players, staff responsibilities, negotiation and leadership skills, and a whole lot more, and the diversity of leagues you can manage in gives you a great perspective on world football in general. This is the closest thing to a real manager job available. One thing I hope is included is the North African leagues which are all top African leagues that have a significant number of the continent's most decorated teams, and a save in one of them I believe would be a good experience."

1100600,0,0,7.65612E+16,236,13,1,840,"18 June, 2020","It's a few years since I played Football Manager extensively. What I can say, over 800 hours into FM2020 is it's well worth a play. Yes you still get 'FM'd' on occasion, and yes that's incredibly frustrating. But I've also nicked a 1-0 when I've been comprehensively outplayed on a fair few occasions.   Having skipped the last couple of iterations, FM2020 felt like a new experience for me, the team dynamics, the training and the new ways of scouting all enhanced my gameplay and you can really feel the difference in the game engine when you employ different styles of football. Wing Play for example compared with Tika-Taka shows very differently in a match environment. My latest save, with York City, has been an amazing journey from the bottom to the premier league and this is the beauty of Football Manager, in my opinion, it allows you to experience fantasy (York will unlikely ever be in the premier league) but grounds it in reality so you get the satisfaction of your achievement."

1100600,0,0,7.65612E+16,25,1,-1,649.2,"7 June, 2020","In summary - a brilliant game let down by a less than adequate match engine.Having logged nearly 500 hours and played through 9 seasons, unfortunately I cannot look beyond the glaring issues on match day any longer. Ultimately, the higher up the divisions you go, the more frustrating the match engine gets.Cons - 1. One on ones are completely broken. You will find that in the lower leagues the problem may not be as prevalent due to awful goalkeeping being a regular occurrence, but once you reach the top divisions, keepers are impossible to beat or your player misses the target 99 times out of 100. The AI misses chances too, but let's not ignore a fundamental flaw. I think the missed chances are relating to match engine balancing - it is too easy to generate one-on-one situations so the conversion rate is kept artificially low by dreadful finishing.  2. Set pieces are far too powerful, leading to a myriad of goals. Penalties and goals scored from direct free kicks are realistic, but corners and indirect free kicks are too bigger source of goals.3. Inexcusably, the set piece creator does not mirror what is seen on match day, so you have a game which doesn't replicate the instructions you have assigned in this area. This can lead to conceding goals that otherwise would not have been conceded. Specifically, throw ins are a complete farce and need a rethink from the developers. You cannot have one throw in instruction for defending and one for attacking, it needs to be split into four sections - the defensive quarter near your own goal, two quarters either side of the halfway line and the attacking quarter near the opponents goal. 4. Goal variety - set piece, cross followed by a back post header from a winger, long shot, winger dribbling 50 yards into the area and an occasional error. I can count on one hand how many times I've witnessed a central midfielder assist via a through ball. There needs to be a complete overhaul of movement in the opposition's half to generate a more fulfilling goal variety.Pros -      1. Everything outside of the match engine, seriously. Massive kudos to the development team here as the games feels very polished and rewarding.  This edition is the equivalent of playing GTA's story all the way to the end, then for a big screen to pop up saying they didn't get a chance to finish the final mission. Damn."

So far I'm enjoying it, and I've been noticing some problems especially in the ME as everyone will say, the players are still unable to perform realistically to their skills. If Tony Kroos has a 20 vision and still he can't make obvious passes to a teammate then why the hell even have a vision attribute. I mean, maybe you guys need computers with a better performance to improve drastically your ME? So I sometimes use the 2D vision and I get one with the game.

Awesome for people who really like to start from scratch.Con: You simply donÂ´t know how to do it properly, even with 220+ hours played and guides read. I have no idea how strong an opposing team truly is, a forward with attack 6 is ultmiately able to punish your carefully selected defense 12+ with 2 goals."

This is not just the case with established world class players: even youngsters I sign at 18, after their first breakthrough season on a meagre wage, become world class divas the next season and steady the ship.So my options: to carry on with mediocre squad players and stay in mid-table until I eventually get sackedâ€“â€“or buy the wonderkids and precipitate my downfall that way.For the people who are sceptical: i got to a point in my game where a wonderkid (on 20k per week) rejected my contract offer of 150k per week + bonuses, all of the squad decided *he* had been unfairly treated and had low morale, and i had a game coming up against the 17th place team in bad form. i played this one game 8 different times, using different tactics and team-talks, and lost every time. The odds are impossibly stacked against you if you have just one big-time charlie in your team!Increased player power is a reality in the modern game. But it shouldn't get to the point where one player is able to scupper the entirety of the game!"

I can never recommend anyone to buy FM 2020 this year! The 1 on 1 are so poor that you only get a 1% chance to score against all those godly goalkeepers from de gea all the way down to some unknown gk from the sunday league! Gk are just way too OP this year and i demand to see a change from next year's FM!!!!!!!!! Not to say penalties are useless in this game too. Same goes for FM 2020 mobile.

Get ready for:-players who haven't scored for a whole season score against you-former players score against you-your star players put in a 6.2 performance in big matches when they obviously (enjoy big matches)-Goals ruled out because a player who is not participating in anyway is offisde-bottom teams play like Barca and beat you-competitors thrashed the same opponents that beat you-get scored against in dying minutes, several times (I once conceded 3 goals in stoppage time to lose a game)-players getting unhappy for stupid reasons (too many don't wanna list all)-AI wants a premium from you for their players and offer 5m for your 50m valued player and ask you to pay 50% of his wagesHighly recommend this game to anyone who thinks all of the above are realistic because ""it happens in real life"" and ""you just need to get good""."

Think football (or soccer in America) doesn't make sense or you don't know the game.  It doesn't really matter.  This game has the deepest database, most realistic simulation (in-game and over multiple seasons) and gives you the depth of running a whole organization.The 2020 version is the best and most realistic yet.  The youth development and planning portion of the game is the best yet.  The ability to sign and develop youth has long been most gamer's favorite parts of the series.  The added depth in this version takes it to a new level.  I greatly enjoy building a team from scratch, developing youth into world class footballers and making waves in the transfer market.  People have complained about the match engine.  I am yet to see an issue.  I think those complaining have never watched a real game and seen the same things happen.I would try to get the game on sale but would pay full price for it (especially if you don't already have one of the series).  You will not be disappointed.  There is no feeling like trouncing your rival to win the championship for your league or in a cup game."

Makes the matches look really cartoonish compared to FM19. In addition 2) the legal limitations to be able to download correct 3D kits (and other graphical elements) is completely ruining the game for me. It'll be OK this year as the previous seasons kits work in the game, but for FM21 it just won't be the same to play the game without all the grapichal enhancements.

It really lets down what should have been a thoroughly enjoyable game. 90% of goals are from corners and free kicks. you could create 18 chances in a game with 5 one on ones and the opposition keeper will save it all. sounds like an exaggeration right... same thing I thought. I played one season till october i.e 3 months and I couldn't stomach anymore. it's the 1st FM game I'm quitting and not going back to. these things used to be addictive. the Match Engine was heaven in 03/04 and just kept getting progressively worse. I think the last good one i played was 2012..I won't recommend this to anyone. It's been over 8 months since this game was released and if these errors have not been fixed in that time then the creators just don't care anymore.

The  match animations, although can be clumsy, is respectable and from what I've gathered only the heart pounding moments are played out in slow which makes them truly fun. So far the majority of my experience has been of a national team under 19s. Only thing I can add that may be an improvement is a reason as to why a player would retire early, like a 16 year old whose been called up to the national squad, or the inability to call up a player who wasn't manually removed. There's already so much depth in this game. Definitely recommend this to anybody that wants a full experience in a game rather than just do a couple things and match time."

Anyway, the game is frustrating as the real football season always is, but if we had 15 games where an EPL team keeper was the best player against your team, meaning the opposing GK had 10+ saves, you would say your forwards/strikers were not 4 or 5 stars, or even 3 stars....."

Yes, FM2020, new era of FM. I am excited and can't stop playing. i'll have to leave my ROK for the moment and got zeroed lol.Usually i play with INTER MILAN which already my favorite since 1999. on the other thing, i usually play small team and build it from the scratch... I loan some rising star player and keep doing that until my team have money to spend.Thank you SI for keeping this game. in couple years from now i would like to see some wonderkids i loaned become like Mbappe...."
1100600,1,0,7.65612E+16,2,1,-1,411.7,"15 May, 2020","The gameplay and match engine is frustrating, annoying, and a lot of times unrealistic and doesn't make any sense. I've tried everything I possibly could but for some reason I cannot control possession to save my life. By the way, I am the Bayern Munich manager playing against the likes of Union Berlin or Hamburg or Zwickau and they dominate the game which is the closest thing to impossible that I can think of. I am dropping points to so many draws because for 60 percent of the match I am chasing the ball. The opposition always loves to knock the ball around with no purpose to their passing, just playing keep away, back to their goalie and whatnot and when I finally do get the ball I lose it just as quick as I gained it. Because of this I have a really good defensive record and a low scoring rate. Also scoring sometimes is garbage. I used to only be able to score long range goals from outside the box but now I can't do that anymore. I would even miss obvious clear cut chances that non-pros would make an absolute living off of because the ball doesn't want to or isn't allowed to hit the back of the net.The gameplay is the most important component of the game and if it's this poor in my opinion, what do you really have? Is it really worth buying this game? Besides that I really love the game. Everything is top notch from top to bottom. It is so detailed and fun to manage your club that I find myself playing it all the time. Honestly, I can get over the licensing issues or just find mods online to download. It's just matchdays that I absolutely dread. I almost wish I was not the head coach but rather only another staff member just so I wouldn't have to stress about tactics that are completely useless and just enjoy the other really good components of this game. Update: After playing this garbage some more, I wish i never bought it. Every good thing I said before i take it back because this game is terrible. So frustrating how unrealistic and stupid this all is. I can't deal with this extremely poor match engine where none of your tactics even matter or affect the outcome of the game because its already set even way before the match starts. This match engine alone ruins the whole game and like I said before, if the match engine is this bad, you literally have a worst of the worst game because nothing else good matters. I hate this game so much. I just hope everyone sees this comment before they go wasting their money better spent on something meaningful."

Do you remember the posters we all had in our rooms? The ones with all the players, staff and trophies that were won the previous season. I mean how hard it is to render a picture like that? SI, you have all the tools and brains for it, do not deny us such delights. Don't forget to list the player and staff names as well.- You need to do a better work with the trophy room. Man, put some imagination or send people to see the trophy rooms of big European clubs. - make rivalries and derby games more dynamic and feed it to us as news. If I play 3 final or semi-final games for CL against the same team within 5 seasons, a rivalry could get established. Also, rivalries could get established from high profile transfers. Like Suarez and Coutinho going to Barcelona. Or when a larger team is feeding from a smaller team and buying off their players in bulk. Also there should be some push back against rich and big teams and i am not talking about financial fair play.  - I am still waiting to play as a president/general manager of a club. I know it may sound boring, but it may not be. A lot of us play the game as presidents anyway. Who doesn't click on auto-pick, right? As a president you still have a lot to say about transfers, style of play, vision, etc. plus you will have to negotiate and find sponsors, contractors, staff but the biggest of all joys to get into the dressing room give pep talks or snap a selfie, lol.   *Plus, if you could start as a maintenance and grow through the ranks ;)- And last but not least: Why not have friendly tournaments of indoor football with 6 players on the field? It could be even  for charity. Having those will keep players that are not on international duty sharp. I am telling you, if you add even only one of those to the game for next year, you will make a lot of people happy and make FM 2021 stand out a head above its predecessors and competitions."

Don't get me wrong, as I have had enjoyable moments in the game, but those come less and less the longer I play.First and most importantly, the ME is in need of work.  -Strikers are often on the losing ends of 1v1s way too many times.  I don't know if this done to create some difficulty in the game, but it seems almost impossible to score off these chances.  -Long shots are still a bit too prevalent in this game.-Wingers and fullbacks do not cut back properly when striker is unmarked in box.-Defenders seem to lack any sense of positioning when dealing with set-pieces.  -Players do some weird animation when trying to prevent the ball from going out of bounds.  They manage to save it but then take a number of steps beyond the ball, allowing the opposition to gain possession.-VAR is way too consistent in its decisions.  (ie if called in the box, it will always be a penalty.  If the referee goes to check for offsides, it will always be offside)-Also, VAR sometime call an onside goal, offside (https://community.sigames.com/topic/520454-var-offside-issues/) - Also note that SI will not be updating the ME for FM2020 (https://community.sigames.com/topic/518591-thanks-for-all-the-feedback/) As a result, some of these known bugs/issues will not be resolved (which makes it somewhat a slap in the face that SI still is considering charging full price)Second, AI transfers make no sense-This is more of a gripe than a bug.  Players seem to make moves to other clubs that are either A) questionable or B) the teams would never sell normally.  You are telling me that Liverpool would willingly sell VVD to Paris for Â£60 million?  After a Champions League winning season in which he was a key player for the team?"

1100600,2,0,7.65612E+16,53,1,-1,388.1,"12 May, 2020","I moved Celtic and Rangers into the Vanarama so I can build something.  I've done this in multiple incarnations of this game, so I know to change nation to England, but somehow we are still in the Scottish League Cup (and group stage at that) which has added extra games.  Not a problem as it gave me a chance to field mainly promising U23s against lower league sides.Including friendlies (four I think), I've played 22 games.  I've won 19, with the only defeat being away in the CL playoff, which I won anyway. One draw was in the League Cup group and another was away in a CL qualifier.  We've played one CL group match away to Galatasaray, and came from 2-0 down to win 3-2 and top a group with PSG.Because of the extra matches from the league cup and Europe, we've only played five league matches, which have all been won with a goal difference of 21-1.  We are sitting 8th (only seven points behind) having played five games less than everyone else, and suddenly half my squad have lost faith in me because we are apparently struggling.  It's mainly key players as well who have all had a lot of game time.Perhaps the game is great if you don't edit anything, but you'd think after 20 years of providing an editor, they'd have made the game engine smart enough to deal with odd situations that arise from using it.I attempt to warn the main instigator about his conduct and he says he always conducts himself well on the pitch.  He has no idea the angry meeting has even taken place.Add to that there seems to still be an awful lot of random injuries out of nowhere.  This lot don't seem to be getting any better at anything other than the 3D pitch.  Mind you, my wide players don't seem to be able to take anyone on.  They sprint to the last third, then slowly walk, then get tackled by a guy already lying on the ground.  That guy will then get up and get the ball whilst my guy stands around wondering where he is.Corners don't go anywhere other than into the six yard box to be immediately cleared by a centre half.  Also, the camera angle for corners is horrific.  You can't tell whats happening.So now I have Aberdeen at home in the league cup.  I've attended the prematch interview and one of the questions is ""Aberdeen won't be used to visiting smaller stadiums like CELTIC PARK"".  Seriously, Celtic Park, a smaller stadium than they are used to?  Get a f*****g grip SI.  Why give access to an editor if it is going to do stupid s**t like this.  Yes, I'm now in a lower league, but how can it not realise this?  Why does it look at the stature of the league instead of the actual club?"

Now going into my third year we are boasting a strong winning streak, with Liverpool left in the dust, and our bitter rivals - Manchester United hot on our tails. The game creates a story in itself, the interviews get repetitive but still hold meaning even after the 20th time being asked the same question.

The game had constant errors which I researched fixes to and found some success after changing some settings in the game files. That lasted about a day and then the game wouldn't even launch, so I requested a refund which they graciously provided. About a week later I noticed that this game was available on Steam and figured both Steam and Origin had rights to the game so I re-purchased it through Steam because I trust them more than Origin. Turns out the game is still run through Origin even when you purchase it on Steam. I got a good couple days of non-interrupted game play from the Steam-Origin version until I ran into the same errors as before. Overall this has been a pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ product. I continued to try to play it because I am a big soccer fan and hoped to have some fun playing, but that is basically impossible because Origin and EA are complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.

It doesn't matter how you play, you are never going to win when it is pre-decided that you are going to lose. One match the players are dynamic, next match they can't complete simple passes (without even changing the tactics). The auto interceptions setting means nothing. The defenders always stand like dumb people and the pass goes barely a feet away from them. Its like the game wants me to control all 11 players at the same time. As soon as I switch players the previous player stops defending. And as always the principle of the game is buy to win."

I am literally outnumbered by opponent AI in my own box during a positional attack, I won't even say anything about counterattacks. Worst ""legendary"" difficulty, literally every 60 OVR player becomes Ronaldinho and only does skill moves and holds the ball unnecessary. You score loads of goals, it's not even fun anymore. I remember having to work hard to snap a 1-0 win in Fifa 19 against a legendary AI with a lesser team, now 90% of the games finish after at least 2-3 goals were scored by each side. 71-37 goal difference after 15 games, 4 minutes half, sounds realistic, right? I am a career mode player, always have been and was happy to hear about the new development system and how you can customize your manager, but the visuals are a joke as well. During negotiations, there are always 2 bald guy generic models talking to each other. How is this even possible? It's not completely ruining the gameplay or something, but it's a huge lack of respect towards us as customers. I feel like I bought an unfinished game, a scam. It's the last time I'll ever get a game from this ****hole of a company. Boycotting EA is the only logical solution."

First, why switching focus from the game is considered leaving the match anyway? It does not make sense, as I usually play in 1/4 window mode, what if I misclicked outside of the game window, for example to make a quick message check? Lol that is the most nonsensical thing I have ever experienced and witnessed over years since I started playing games.Second, the game does not promote fair play. Why? Because when stronger team gets their lead, they have the choice to passing the ball around without ANY penalties, for the rest of the game. At least in Fifa Online 4 - a free version of FIFA game which is released for the Asia Market has this kind of penalty, so why is it left out in this game?Third, bugs and bugs everywhere. I have to admit that EA has one of - if not - the worst servers in the world. On average, I have to find match 13 times in order to play a game of FIFA 21, 12 other attempts lead me to a pre-game screen, and if the ""Advance"" button did not disappear after my 3 Enters, I understood that I should better quit and find a new match. Also, sometimes in the game my players got kicked into the air for NO REASONS.In short, all I would like to say is that EA lacks ethics to ever ask people to spend 80$ in such a poorly-invested and chaotic mess. You would never get my money again and for those who are about to buy this game, just dont."

The defence is extremely bad, CDMs (both yours and the AI's) don't help the defenders at all and will stand and watch from outside the box as your defenders get ganged on. They just stroll back for counter attacks. Goal Keepers are spectators and always get beat on the near post. EA focused too much on the attacking aspect of the game and went out of their way to nerf defending. Winning all your games 7 - 3 isn't fun at all for anyone who actually knows the sport. The development plan for players was a welcomed addition but turning all your players to 5* skillers / 5* foot in less than half a season is really dumb. The game wasn't tested and the EA game changers should be ashamed for praising this game. I'm going back to play a modded Fifa 20 instead of playing this trash and that should tell you all you need to know. Definitely DO NOT BUY this game.

For starters I get kicked randomly from online matches and not even like i lose connection, it just boots me out of the window then i disconnect from the game!!! Also its done this to me 3 times now, that I've had to uninstall fifa 21 and reinstall it because when i load it up origins (also â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ platform) says that i don't have the game installed so i have to reinstall it. The fact that these problems are continuous and often really breaks my spirit about this game. I recommended this game to a buddy but quickly before he could buy it I told him its an absolute waste  of money and we would be better off getting PES. Thanks for readying this everyone i just wanted you to know what EA thinks they have and how it actually functions EA is so trash for this a game that has been rereleased over and over and you still cant get it right.

Yeah, they do somethings here and there but in the end itÂ´s just crap.

The market is absurd I bought king (77) for 6M and Eric Garci for 5M o... and these negotiations happenned with two identical avatars, whatÂ´s up with that? I donÂ´t understand why you changed the pre match menu, itÂ´s like youÂ´re intentionally trying to make it worse. So no, the worst game play to date of all the FIFA franchise, loosing teams like Roma or Juventus, a very very raw manager mode, a disorganized menu and the fact that you recycled so much cannot be compensated with players doing tricks more often in matches, FIFA, I think I can finally say IÂ´ve had enough, PES promises to treat me better and IÂ´m gonna try it.

1313860,1,0,nexypl,50,1,-1,50,"25 October, 2020","I've purchased FIFA since 06. Back in the day they really focused on the quality of gameplay and ehnacing the manager mode aspect of the game with every new version. However, since FIFA 2014, they've virtually done nothing for the game other than minute gameplay changes and completely irrelevant and useless career mode  ""upgrades"" that virtually no one asked for or wanted. But that's not even the worst part, because we already grew accustomed to being disappointed for the offline modes. They literally still have glitches that were in the game in FIFA 19. The same exact lineup/team squad glitches from two years ago. This shows there is literally 0 f***s given when it comes to improving the game. As long as they license the teams and make bank off FUT, they literally will sell us the exact same game for years to come. Also, EA openly admitted to scripting. They declined to use that term, but they said they added many certain features to make the game 'realistic' so if the AI suddenly puts together and insane amount of precise passes that leads to a goal, there is little to nothing you can do unless you can predict AI movement. This is the same for online, where your players will randomly become lethargic when you're ahead so that the opponent has a shot to make the match more dramatic. EA is just dishonest with us and gives us the middle finger with every entry because they know we are suckers that'll buy every year. Do yourself a favor and don't be an idiot like the rest of us, and skip this game. Maybe then, they'll actually do something to improve the title."

It is a football game, in my opinion gameplay should be number 1 concern.- The career mode transfers are still totally rubbish and unrealistic like each year.- The non-player controlled AI defending is absolutely rubbish this year. Central midfielders just stand still, and dont mark any opponents. I guess youre supposed to control all players at once ?? - Most ball touch animations look too unrealistic and silly.- Player speed difference is over-exaggerated which results in slow players are more or less useless."

If you want to buy the game DON'T BUY IT ON STEAM rather buy it on Origin, because when you buy it hear, it has to connect to your origin account, and everytime you want to play the game, it automatically logs you to your Origin account. This wouldn't be that bad, only if at least twice a week there wasn't some kind of problem with Origin saying: ""We're sorry but the game is not connected to your account"" or ""We're sorry the game is not downloaded to your computer"" it's so annoying because everytime this happens you have to verify the integrity of the files, and that takes a bit of time + downloading the files that have â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up."

I have bought the game every couple of years and also the World Cup releases in 2010 and 2014 (wish they would do this again, including it with 18 was okay, but I enjoyed the 'Story of Qualifying' Feature). I used to enjoy FUT when you could play in Solo leagues and Cup Tournaments, but now in 21 it's become hot garbage that is geared only for online play with the anti-social dregs of humanity that play these games online. The main feature in FIFA I play for is the Career Mode, and much as many have mentioned they made some incredible improvements in FIFA 21 and I've just been totaly absorbed by the game and have been playing it for hours upon hours starting several different career saves. The dynamic potential for youth players, and the ability to really take a hand in player development including changing players positions to match your tactics rather than the old way where you had to match your tactics to the players you could get is so much more immersive and fun! As a footnote I'll also say that I am perhaps in the minority when I say I actually enjoyed the Volta mode as well (again, only in single player) more than I thought I would. If you enjoy soccer/football do yourself a favor and buy this game, if you liked Career Mode in past versions, you will love the new additions in 21. FUT has become a full on pile of flaming garbage and a money grab, and now totally alienates solo players."

It brings with it some differences concerning the gameplay which can be considered as improvements. There are also innovations in different game modes. The developers worked hard, limiting to refine mechanics and structures in themselves solid for a game that may at first look the same as the one before it, but that actually offers differences, sensitive but effective, especially in terms of control and dynamism. FIFA 21 is a great game. It is a more complete title than its predecessor, although the graphic component is practically identical. The little refinements make the biggest impressions this year, and Iâ€™m excited to see how the next-generation versions will perform.OVERALL SCORE: 9/10"

This makes my players turn like cranes while the other teams moves like Prime Barcelona in 2010.-The game is still coded so it can help the ""bad player"". -Difficulty levels are really bad this year since you can get an easy random goal from a 64 Rated team on Legendary, feels like for a moment the game boosts the team to Ultimate and scores an insane goal with a player with 50 SHO and after the goal they go back to ""normal"" where they can't even touch the ball.-Overpriced for the amount of ""Improvements"" it has."

Then have a week or so wait to download the next option file. So, I decided to move over to FIFA for the slick presentation and official licencing knowing full well the on-pitch experience would be somewhat 'diluted'. I was happy to trade a little bit of on-pitch authenticity and excitement for a more rounded gaming experience.I am pleasantly surprised. The gameplay is miles ahead of what I remember from FIFA games. It's fluid, creative and takes a lot of time to master. No longer are you tied to rails with only a few control options. You now have an exhaustive list of controls including agile dribbling, customisable passing and shooting options, different ways to control runs off the ball and much more. The ball still feels a little 'light' and almost floats but nothing game-breaking. It's also a lot more unpredictable than before with lots of collisions, spills and loose balls. The biggest thing for me is that it doesnt feel fake or forced - each game is unique and the replay value is still there many games into career mode. All in all, it's a really competent on-pitch experience that gives PES a run for its money. Then, obviously, you move on to the off-field experience. Having the real music, intros, stadiums, kits etc makes a huge difference to the player. It's incredibly immersive.Finally, the career mode is leagues ahead of Master League on PES. With player happiness, sharpness, training and development there is plenty of man-management going on. Having the ability to manually negotiate contracts and transfers in a fantastic little mini game is also very welcome. You can also sim games and drop-in/drop-out at will which gives a sort of football manager/FIFA hybrid which is excellent for giving players a full career mode experience without having to play every single minute of every single game. Taking control of key fixtures is essential but you are welcome to watch more simple games from a birds eye management view. And if things are going surprisingly badly, just put yourself in the game to try and turn things around. It's an excellent addition.Not the perfect football game but as an overall experience it is very hard to beat. PES still wins on the pitch but that gap has been closed. Off the pitch, FIFA is the superior experience by a long margin."

This game has bugs and glitches that have been present for 3+ years. This game is nothing more than FIFA 18 with a few updates equivalent to a DLC. Sad to say I've been a fan of this series since FIFA 10, and I can confidently say there has been very few worthy upgrades to the series in the last decade. There are, in fact, features that were present in that iteration of this game that aren't present in this years edition, or have even been present since. If you're looking for a poorly optimized gambling simulator, then go ahead and sink your money into this pile of hot, sweaty garbage. The developers clearly do not care about this series, EA does not care about the Madden series, they do not care about the 2K series, they do not care about the UFC series, they do not care about their fans.If you don't believe me, look into the lead developer of Madden who claimed having a Meracritic score of 2.0 (the lowest on the sites history) was better than 1. Look into FIFA shamelessly advertising the blatant gambling section of this game in a childrens magazine, listing it as the second step to enjoying this game.This game is a sad joke and, if I hadn't accidentally allowed to game to run while I was away at work for 2 days, I would have gotten my money back.Shame on you, EA.Pros:It's soccer.

Relegating became the move and now I am kinda enjoying myself in D3-4 where I only play against a Neymar every other game and squads are usaully 84-87 overall. Fifa 21 is FIfa 20 with new player instructions but still the same ole EA BS Fifa game."

1313860,1,1,AidenJack,143,25,-1,208.2,"23 October, 2020","Same sh!t new year. I dont know why I decided to buy this game but I did and I very stupidly and I got champions edition cuz I wanted that 3 days early access (not worth it). Also I thought it would be a good idea to waste another Â£5 on EA access to get the game for 10 hours about a week before release (worth = 5/10). Servers w... well... I did say same sh!t new year so you can already guess what I have to say about the servers. Bugs. Bugs. The game is filled with them and EA sit back, watch the racks roll in and do fu*k all about it. I was playing div rivals and tbh I wouldnt care if there was a bug because its not too competitive but oh dear, I get into FUT Champions and my second match I play my camera freezes in 1 place after I foul the other guy. So im stuck there and the game is playing on but im there not being able to do anything, nice. Had to leave that match. Simple bugs like the menu bug where when you go to play and scrool along to the right you cant go left again you have to go back and then into it again. EA are useless w*nkers and honestly I hope their company goes bust because then I dont get sucked into buying this game every year for a new color scheme and a small menu update that btw this year is sh!t. The menu is cancer this year and I fu*king hate it. Honestly there is so much more sh!t I could throw at this game but its not worth my time for this literal cancer game. Launcher is w*nk. Servers are sh!t. Menu is w*nk. Gameplay is same apart from there new runs you can make your players do which when you are in game you dont even use because you are more focused on not losing the ball rather than making you player do a manual run. Its easier to just through ball them. Only good thing they did this year was add the agile dribbling, thats pretty sick. Pro clubs literally same. Career mode everyone gets hyped over being able to sim your game effectively by jumping in and making subs while in the simulation screen. Well guess what ret*rds. You are getting hyped over old features lol, yep thats right, that used to be in old Fifa's but now they added it back. EA best company. Also the release was complete shambles, so I generally got scammed by EA by the game coming alot later than it should have but you know, it is what it is and its EA were talking about here so we don't expect much.

It's a great gaming experience. But the content in the game is not at par with the price. At INR 3999, its one of the costlier games in the market, and it has very little to show for it. Lets start with what it lacks.1. A story. Starting with the Journey I found a newfound interest in sports games thanks to the story mode. In FIFA 21, there is a story mode in the game under VOLTA football- the Debut, but the story is far too short to be that interesting, it keeps us hanging definitely.2. Lack of official stadiums- The game doesnt include a lot of official stadiums including Camp Nou, probably because PES got their rights.3. Weird facial glitches during celebrations- I've been playing at 1920*1080 at ultra and sometimes while celebrating the players facial expressions get twisted into weird angles.It's really good, the graphics are fantastic, the mechanics are extraordinary, but still to my personal opinion it's not worth the buck. If you get it on a sale, grab it."

Or I can be 2-0 or 3-0 and for some f*cking reason they catch me up of worse beat me like you have got to be kidding me. It is so evident you made a system that touches and manipulates the human mind with pain and reward to entice you to spend for a ""better team and a better time"". I mean it is widely known that major companies employ psychologist to make a game or system that makes the company most money.Although I regrettably bought this game knowing what frustrations it would bring (I missed playing football so that's the only reason why I bought it) I will never ever buy fifa points and made a promise to only play modes that don't involve money."

EA did realise that there were issues in attacking play, which is good. Their solution of absolutely nullifying any sort of defensive play, not so much. Ultimate team, being the only really competitive game mode enhances the gameplay issues much more than any other one. With less unnatural and overpowered players in seasons the gameplay feels a lot less like rabid dog running around the pitch with chimpanzees trying to defend your goal. But it's still showing there as well. Career mode has had some changes and improvements taking many of the elements of football manager, but the computer AI is way too weak to pose any sort of competition for anyone whose played the game before. With this the actual ""playing"" element  of career mode has become very boring, not good. Volta, basically, street football was surprisingly decent this year. The different environments, the in game commentary and soundtrack all added a very nice touch and with different available players such as boxing star AJ made the game mode feel very arcadesque, which it is supposed to feel like. With very different gameplay to the regular game it somewhat complements the mode without really bringing any sort of substance or pull to play, still a good breath of fresh air. The new gameplay elements do not seem to work as poorly with Pro Clubs, since you and your friends can actually use players  defensively. Even with only some minor changes being the ""party mode"" of FIFA this is the most enjoyable game mode.I would seriously not recommend anyone buying the game if your main purpose would be to play Ultimate Team, if you're really interested in any other game mode, buy it at half price."

I dont expect offense to be always making a perfect run, but... even still... they barely ever do any of this. If im not in direct control of a player, theyre basically jogging everywhere. Players dont make runs unless i use the command to, and yes, i have changed tactics and whatnot. The ball will bounce around my defenders feet often and then just continue on the course the attacker had it on originally.... and omg the number of times the opponent has attackers just run up the field no coverage is scary. The AI is literally borderline non existent. Its just laughable. Not to mention how defenders you make an inside cut on can magically magnetize spin around and steal the ball from you. And please for the love of god IRL players almost never ever get the ball stolen from them from behind. Theres a reason this is my first fifa game in 3 years. 18 was maybe a little better than this. Typical FUT is ruined by people who pay to win. Im a casual player. Not a streamer, not someone who is can play this 6-8 hrs a day. I do not recommend this game.

The Players also don't listen to your commands a lot of the time which makes stuff really annoying. The Passing in this game sucks, you press a full bar of power to pass and it goes super slow, tap it slightly and it gets kicked 60MPH, no consistency.

1313860,2,0,dinbo_III,20,1,-1,37.3,"18 October, 2020","This game is awful. FIFA does a great job of making sure that your game will not stay in progress or that you will not have fun at any point in time. From it being impossible to intercept the ball on defense to not knowing where your pass is going to go, FIFA makes the game of soccer unpredictable in the worst ways. All you play against in ultimate team are people who spend 2000 dollars on day one to have the most broken team that is impossible to beat. Don't even get me started on the origin services that make you alt+tab out of the ongoing FIFA match you are in. (THIS HAS HAPPENED 9 TIMES OUT OF MY 40 GAMES NOW) They added some good features like being able to angle your AI in the orientation you would like by using the right stick, but that is really the blunt end of what EA has done well. If you want to pull your hair out almost every time you log onto the game and play against people who pace abuse and sweat the ball every game, this one's for you. Don't waste your time."

If you play FUT or online then look away now because this isn't for you.The game play does seem alot more fluid, there is a decent flow, but with that said one of the things EA bragged about were runs off the ball and for the most part the AI off the ball is awful. My AI team mates constantly point for a through ball then immediately abandon that run as I make the pass....much more so than in FIFA20.Individual flair is easier in this FIFA and I'm not sure if that is good or not. Your team can win and lose on a single players performance and with lower league teams, trying to balance winning and having a sharp team with having to use reserves is torture.I always used to play as Bury but since they went bust I play as Salford and my object or winning league two and turning a 27mil profit in season one.....reallly......Career mode so far is better than previous. I like the more random play. Interceptions and deflections seem more likely though it does make shooting from distance in open play totally useless. It seems more chaotic when you are not in control and more satisfying when you are tiki taking your way to goal and that is all well and good but there are still pitfalls. There was a moment where my defender was repelled from the ball by an unseen force and still EA denies scripting....I don't think this game deserves the hate I have had for previous instalments because they have improved career. Does it justify the price tag? That is on you as the payee"

'1v1' seems to be the cause. As one defender is programmed to only mark one attacker, many positional and logical problems arise. There's no contextual logic at all. I've provided many video examples with further explanation below.What happens when the bug occurs? Midfielders (and wingers, sometimes defenders also) will just stand still like they're 'switched off' and will not come across to mark logical danger. They simply just stand there and watch. The '1v1' feature brought in in FIFA 20 seems to be the cause of this. We can't micro-manage our entire team one by one to play a team sport. In the examples you'll see below, you'll see how this manifests many times throughout a match. All examples provided are on legendary difficulty also.What should be happening instead? The AI should be 'engaged' at the very least. They need to track runs and react to danger. At the moment the midfielders simply stand still and don't engage. This is not the AI 'holding our hand' at all, this is just basic football logic that the rest of your team should track runs and engage.There's a big gameplay issue with midfielders not tracking runs or engaging in defensive duties/shape at all.

There aren't enough changes in the offline aspect to justify it. They have introduced 'new' features that were in the game in 2015/16. They have added 'new' gameplay features that were in FIFA 2004. No seriously, FIFA 2004 had off the ball AI control and now EA are touting it as a new feature. Oh and did i mention Goalkeepers are broken, they cant save low driven shots if it was there job. The midfield is also broken, they dont track back and leave your defenders exposed. The game is basically re-skinned, given a new UI and the squads are updated, then EA dumps all of its care into Ultimate Team because thats what makes them money. Game is not worth it."

FIFA has been plagued by horrible passing for years now, but this has come to the point of the computer sabotaging your attack far too frequently while awarding your opponent (who more often than not has a godly meta squad) with silly bounced balls to the man in front of an empty net.There is also again the issue with a one way meta. If you want to win against meta squads, you yourself either have to be a lot better than the opponent, or have to have the same meta squad yourself. Which again makes the game just dull when facing the same exactly teams over and over again.But then again it's EA.

This mode is completely unplayable.Pro clubs is just the same old and so is every other mode except for Manger mode with some new little functions, albeit you will still see players signing for teams that they shouldn't be in etc.Like I said I highly regret buying this game, it's the same old rush job with Fifa year in year out with broken game modes except for ultimate team obviously."

You will automatically start making some wired mistakes like passing to wrong direction or having some weird commands that you make will be twisted up like passing into player that is in the other side of the pitch instead of the player who are 2 meters away just for the sake of giving the ball to the opponent who failed to take it from you.I still can't understand why they nerfed headers so hard and didn't do anything to rebound goals (if not buffed the rebounds).I mean, the game will make you rage a lot but still better than Fifa 20 and PES 2021 so yeah, we have no other option."

However, on one occasion, when I was playing SB, a glitch happened and the AI computer took over my gameplay. Not wanting to forfeit the match, I allowed the game to play out and got a victory. Shortly after, I receive an email from EA, describing how I am a cheater and got a 7 days suspension. Also, they deleted my FUT team just before un-suspending my account. So I began the long process of rebuilding my team. Note that a couple of objectives were already collected on my previous FUT team so I lose those easy objective bonuses. I could not change my team name too. Also, I lost all my pre-order bonuses. I had a long online text chat with EA and they could not do anything to help me. When I had a decent enough team, I went to play Division Rivals. That was when I met the REAL hackers. I was hit with the disconnect hack which is pretty common. See more here: https://fifaforums.easports.com/en/discussion/567414/current-state-of-playing-fifa-21-on-the-pcSo the irony of the situation is that all these hackers are getting away scot free, while me, just an average dude that wants to play a game of football on my PC gets suspended from EA with all my bonuses thrown out.

Shots at any 10 - 60 degree angle are unstoppable, reduced effectiveness of possession ball and curling shots. The FUT model is pay to win and EA still massively underpaying in in game coins for each win. Loot is still non existent for grinding, You end up having to pay money to get better, pay money to have a chance of getting a Legend. This also means FUT has major gambling levels of addictive content. This game should not be rated E at all. This needs to stop, not is it horrible game design but highly predatory in approach. Fut should be a beautiful experience where you have access to team building and playing with the greats of your choice. I've reached out to Chris Lee from the House of Representatives to investigate the style of loot boxes and EA's Fifa practices. They need to either ban this game are change the way it is designed. Furthermore to avoid gambling addiction do NOT buy Fifa points.... This is a warning to all gamers. DO NOT BUY FIFA POINTS!

The gameplay is fluid and easy to pick up coming from PES. PES21 does have the better footballing simulation gameplay, but in terms of the player control FIFA21 has it beat.

You may be not aware of that but actually there are lots of differences in the game play. The game is more smooth, more easy to attack hard to defend and I've never encountered any bugs or players going through with each other. Graphics are awesome, pitches are great. Origin and steam are working perfectly with each other, no lag no fps drop and I'm playing in ultra settings,4x anti aliasing with 160 fps. You can easily find lots of players. Career mode is my favourite which has lots of new features like promoting new players to new positions or trainings, but most importantly the simulation. You can simulate the game and there are commentators to comment too! It feels like football manager which is pretty dope. There are few new features that I forgot to tell too.Also I've been playing FIFA since FIFA 2016 and this game is better than FIFA 2020 and if someone is saying that the game is too fast, you can make it slower in settings but it is not, actually its more slow than FIFA 2020 and it's just like what it has to be. The AI seems more intelligent and realistic, hardest level is pretty dope.Also, I think FIFA 2021 is the best FIFA game ever.So, A big thumbs up for me."

I mean what do you expect? I also haven't played FUT so no complaints here about loot boxes or pay to win mechanics. Since Fifa '15, the game has improved a lot. I love the changes to Career Mode, specifically with the flexibility of simming and the more in-depth scouting, negotiations, and transfers. Volta, which is completely new to me, is also really cool and a fun - more casual - change of pace. Of course since '15 I expected a substantial improvement in graphics, which I think are there to some extent, but what's more noticeable are the dynamic animations. Player physics are great and realistic interaction with other game objects/players seems much improved. The main reason I recommend Fifa '21 is because it works. No bugs, no screen tearing, no complaints. Playing on ultra with my Gtx 1080 and no fps issues.  The AI is responsive and challenging. The soundtrack is killer.  I say go for it."

First the good, well passing and intricate play is their and shooting feels really nice, and they also stopped the cut in move whatever it was. They brought in no fitness which was a hassle to keep buying fitness cards. Career mode is probably the best it has been in a long long time. Coins are also very easy to get now so you might be able to get your favorite players on a team. Now the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ bad and its alot to unravel but i will just type what pops in my damned head. First of all â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ through balls are broken as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Defending is manual but the ai still â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the bed a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ton. Keepers are damn near useless, might as well have aguero in goal. You know how I said through balls are broken passing is too. You could try to pass it to a player 5 yards in front of you and the ai or what else makes the decision on how fast the ball goes pegs your player and he just kinda â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ himself. Also to end this con part of the review midfielders unless it is kante, sissoko, or torreira they will not and I repeat not have any defensive ai their. Welp I wrote this hella late for no reason other then to write a review. When fifa 22 comes out next year I might just copy and paste this review. Still liked the game though"

1313860,0,0,7.65612E+16,68,6,1,17.6,"12 October, 2020","Best Fifa in 5 years (imo) I've bought every Fifa since 03 and pretty much exclusively play Career mode and online seasons. The last 2 or 3 Fifa's i've really hated the gameplay, animations especially felt very stiff and robotic and unrealistic.. plus the crossing and headers have felt 'off' for a few years now. This year it got to the point I almost didn't buy it as I thought the gameplay would be the same, after watching a few youtube videos I noticed the animations looked a bit more fluid, the pace looked more realistic and the career mode a few small tweaks that I liked IE the development plan system where you can change a players position for example a RW being coached into a CM role. I bought the game and i'm happy to say that yes the gameplay is much improved with a LOT of small tweaks ! the animations are far more varied and fluid when dribbling, crossing, shooting etc and this year you can finally head in corners and crosses and actually take volly's without them going into row z. Also FINALLY players make intelligent runs off the ball both offensively and defensively. The defending finally feels good with players challenged to position themselves well and force opposing players onto their weak foot or blocking off paths instead of the usual 'charge at them with one button and tackle.' Career mode though needing a bit more love is taking small steps in the right direction by adding training, loan to buy options, negotiating outside of transfer windows for pre-contracts and the previously mentioned development plan and youth academy.overall if you too haven't liked the last 2 or 3  Fifas like me this maybe a good time to jump back in. theres a lot of troll reviews from people that rather don't like Fifa or even don't like sports games in general saying it's the same game every year which I understand the point but also realise this isn't an RPG where you can overhaul loads of mechanics and add crazy new features it's a sports game with defined rules and what's expected so I kind of understand each year is more or less small tweaks and features rather than some complete overhaul. If you like Fifa get it, you know what you are buying it's just a better version of the last few Fifa's if you are waiting for some mystical magical complete overhaul of the whole game where there's so many changes it becomes a battle royal then.. well yeah you won't like it this year either"

Changes as to career mode are quite minimal but changes the aspect of training the players even better by giving you the choice to change their positions, how their play style will be (like more attacking midfielder or more play making attacker etc). Career mode also has more in-depth in club schedule like setting when the players will train, rest, and recover for their next games. Volta is now more fast paced and fun specially if you are playing with your friends in a team game. Kick-off is mostly the same just with more party modes. FUT I haven't played that much during the time of this review since I have played FUT but I never really get into it after the next 2 weeks of the games release. All the other modes I didn't talk about in this review either don't interest me or got minimal to no change at all.

The sim match feature and being able to jump in mid match is certainly a great feature, but just like many things in FIFA, its an old feature that is just being brought back, I remember FIFA 11 on the PSP had this feature, but hey it's EA Sports amiright. Training feature is better this year with being able to train your entire squad regularly rather than the 5 players are just usually limited to. Transfer is more unique with at the beginning of the save you are asked if you want the transfer to be loose or strict and now CPU teams can offer to trade players, so transfer are now more unique. Being able to change a player's position is also neat, and being able to improve their weak foot and skill moves is also good."

It's like your paying for a bundle with so many different games in it. Definitely recommend getting this if you haven't touched the series in a long while OR if you are a new player.One thing I hate though is when the game suddenly bugs out whenever a penalty is given and whoever committed the foul or handball just walks straight into oblivion while the camera is pointed at him. This goes on for a minute until the game realizes it's a penalty. LOL.EDITED: Some typos and tried to use better words.

Oh... the reason why I stopped buying them? The price wasn't worth ANY of the updates. Why would I pay 60-70 euros a year for just some simple kit and team changes? Oh right, Ultimate Team was receiving updates... but you know, not everyone cares about that part of the game at all, since it's just aimed at getting people to buy packs. I'm more of a career mode fan myself.FIFA 21 isn't much better than it's predecessors. Aside from the improved simulation feature in career mode, I don't think it's even better at all. But to pay the price of a full game just for a better simulation feature? Nope, that's pretty bad. Player career mode seems like a simple copy and paste from years ago, just with a few more bugs. Just buy FIFA 12 and you'll probably have a more satisfying experience."

In gameplay, FUT still feels like Fut, scripting is still a thing, although not really apparent in most of my games. Career Mode havenâ€™t touched it yet, will do it at a later date. Volta, I WILL NOT BE PLAYING THIS and AGAIN WHY IS IT IN THE GAME! Pro Clubs is where itâ€™s ALL AT!!!! Pro clubs is the best thing to happen to fifa, although EA did strip alot of great features from previous versions. I still love the fact that I can change the buttons around, has been a thing since the first time I played fifa, (I think it was fifa 98). Anyway, I was in a car accident when I was three and my left side is partially paralyzed. What the button switching allows me to do is put everything essential on the right side of the controller which is great!!!! I would recommend this game if youâ€™re ok with the scripting and sometimes sluggish players. I mean after all it is EA, EA Sports itâ€™s in the Script!

But ultimately decided to give it a thumbs up because it is an improvement over the previous game and I'm sure I'll end up putting many hours into it. As primarily a FUT player, here is my experience so far. Pros:- Completion of the placement matches and promotions in Division Rivals now give coin rewards- Player fitness cards have been removed, allowing you to stick with the same team each match- Heading and crossing has been drastically improved- The overall pace of the game has been slowed down and feels better- Defending is more reliable and mistakes seem slightly less commonCons:- Practically no new features- Many of the interfaces look identical to FIFA20- Graphics haven't been improved in any meaningful way- Commentators are as bland as ever, with many of the soundbites being taken directly from FIFA20- Price OverallThe gameplay feels more realistic and balanced and the removal of fitness cards makes team management easier. But the lack of innovation makes it really hard to justify the Â£55 price tag. If you're a big FIFA fan or are looking to get into the series, the game is fun enough and is probably worth getting. But if you're looking for anything beyond what we saw last year, it's not worth the money.RATING: 6/10"

1313860,4,0,7.65612E+16,86,7,-1,21.1,"10 October, 2020","So, ill start with what annoys me already. 10.10,2020. Players still do not have proper minifaces. Cavani with none is a joke, van de Beek with Ajax's miniface from last year. What is this? Did EA not have enough time for little details? Game is Fifa20.5 and I was ready for that. Just like everyone. But screwing up with easiest things? Really? What next? Gonna forget to add Messi's miniface? Cant wait to play Barcelona with 11 grey, empty faces in career screen. Young, most proliffic players still with no real faces? Greenwood? Odegaard? Fati? Diaby? They have potential close to 90, THEY WILL BE USED by players and you know that. But we get real faces for 50 overall players in none-knows-what leagues. Im sure Career mode players like me are all happy about that. I wont waste time to whine about same, annoying main menu or slight changes that could be invented 5 years ago - some of them were available 10 years ago, then deleted so could be ""invented"" again. Just no.After 7hours - because steam asked if i changed my mind - No. Still negative. Same game menu since 2017? Works slower in every next fifa - however its appearance stays exactly the same so how does it work? Give old stuff and make it eat more resources? -  which discourages me to even start the game. Gameplay is ripped off from fira20 - who would have thought - but playing matches is still quite enjoyable. Yet it was enjoyable in fifa17,19,20 - I have them all - aswell so if someone just want to kick the ball - stick to... 19? Was good enough. But I'm career mode player and I simulate 80% of the matches so if menu works slow, game works slow, progress is slow... Season takes twenty hours instead of few and i kinda enjoy to finish season in two days. Come back from work, play a season, buy new player or two, have fun. Nope, DO IT SLOW. Positive things r manual trainings. Do them once, all others u can simulate and get highest manually achieved rating - cool, i like it. However trainings r retarded cos game chooses players by itself and u have change it all by urself in very annoying way. For example - u have shooting training but game automatically chooses three defenders to do it. Wanna change it? Feel free but first u have to make sure players u want to choose r not selected in any other training session. Takes 10-15min to do that with all players. Really? Simple code would be sufficient to pick offensive players for offensive training sessions automatically. Nope, too hard. Negotiations with other managers? Whateva. They still dont rly care about new things added to game. After 5 transfer windows they sent me swap deal once. ONCE. So what r we talking about?  it almost does not exist. Also - what annoys me extremaly - u cant convince player to accept lower squad role than he wants. U just cant. In old Fifas u could give him more money and ask to be freaking prospect - No problem. Deal. Just pay me 200k. Fifa21 - NO. Im 34 years old player, but my stats r quite high so important or Crucial. Wanna give me more money? Sure, but still important or crucial. And like i said - it was already available long, long ago. Sumamry - I see nice things in fifa21 but this game should literally be DLC to fifa20... For 25% of its price. Dont buy. Dont waste ur money if u r casual player. After 7 hours i simply uninstalled the game and i regret every penny i spent on it. BTW. 14.10,2020 Still no Cavani face. RIP.21,10,2020 After a week wih bald career mode managers new update fixed... nothing. 1,1gb patch that changed literally nothing that could affect ingame bugs. They invented more."

1313860,0,0,Scorchhh,166,3,1,205.4,"9 October, 2020","You know the drill.If you enjoyed the gameplay of previous Fifa games then you'll have a good time here and vice versa. As for ultimate team the story stays the same. You will find it very hard going up against those that pour money into this game right at the beginning. However, from what I've seen, getting a decent team at the beginning doesn't take too long due to coins being much easier to attain through objectives and rivals etc. You simply need to find cheap players with decent stats for their rating (I would recommend building a Serie A team should you want to save some dosh).Bugs and glitches didn't happen to me very often. I only really saw them in the Volta gamemode and training sessions though your experience may vary.The pricing in my opinion is honestly quite fair considering the amount of time you will probably pour into this game (Trust me grinding is needed should you want that sweet sweet ultimate team. Then again you have to bear in mind that you are essentially paying for what is an update on the previous game so if you simply want a solid football game and do not care about ultimate team then I would not recommend you to make the purchase. Overall just your standard Fifa game from EA. You probably already know by now if your going to buy it or not."

1313860,5,0,7.65612E+16,371,11,-1,1.5,"9 October, 2020","Cons: - The size of the ball, as nitpicking as it sounds. Since FIFA 17 the ball is about 15% smaller than it should be -- compare to a real football broadcast and like me you will never ""unsee"" it again. Say what you want, but for me it's an immersion breaking issue.- Non intuitive defence mechanics, as always. ""Contain"" and ""teamate contain"" are just a waste of two buttons, as they are totally useless. WTH.- Custom controller settings simply vanish sometimes, so it's necessary to configure it all over again, and again.- Exagerated production focus on the infamous FUT.- Last but not least: I began to play FIFA in 2009 and since then every edition (except 2010 World Cup) keeps the same problem: it's way easier to win as visitor against the AI. I just can't stand this. Dear EA: it's the other way around, guys.Pros:+ Attacking is easy and fluid.+ Presentation, as usual.+ You can turn off the music.+ Unlike PES, manual replays are well done.+ In-game visuals.+ The crowd and general stadia atmosphere.+ Licenses.+ TV broadcast feeling."

I would strongly recommend against buying this unless you're upgrading from at latest fifa 18. I've switched to buying a new fifa every 4 years because of how little they change in terms of the actually fun modes. If you care about ultimate team and using your wallet to play soccer then go ahead and buy this version, otherwise if you play career mode or pro clubs or anything thats not ultimate team, I would just say save your money for a couple releases and then buy when it seems kind of better (will probably be at least 3-4 years). They haven't really changed much at all about career mode, just nicer looking menus and a couple of somewhat new features that are only new because they were in previous fifas and removed to be put back just now. It's pretty sad that this is the case but its just reality at this point. I would love to stop buying fifa at all and just switch to football manager, but i miss being able to actually play as your team."

The sim match feature and being able to jump in mid match is certainly a great feature, but just like many things in FIFA, its an old feature that is just being brought back, I remember FIFA 11 on the PSP had this feature, but hey it's EA Sports amiright. Training feature is better this year with being able to train your entire squad regularly rather than the 5 players are just usually limited to. Transfer is more unique with at the beginning of the save you are asked if you want the transfer to be loose or strict and now CPU teams can offer to trade players, so transfer are now more unique. Being able to change a player's position is also neat, and being able to improve their weak foot and skill moves is also good.I want to praise them, but then again a lot of these are just easy things they could've added yearssss ago. We all know these are not new ideas, there are already millions of videos on these things from years ago.Oh and as for gameplay, its FIFA, you really expecting many changes there? Other than the ability to change the direction of the player making a run. It's not much different. Perhaps I can say that while FIFA 20 was very defensive, this is a bit quicker and scoring goals is so much easier, for better or for worse, you decide.In conclusion I give it a ""meh"". But because its steam I'll give it a thumbs up I guess.*edit: I want to add that they really need to improve the midifeld defending. When defending the midfield just stands there forcing me to pull defenders breaking up the line. They really need to fix this up."

The only good thing is that now their games are on Steam we can tell them exactly what we think of them publicly and they can't hide. I paid for the 'Ultimate' edition and they delivered the ultimate crappy launch experience. Presumably this will be fixed but seriously. How inept can you be.

The player feel like a tank, rather than an athletic player who can run and change positions quickly. As for shooting, if anything changed it is now worst. One can't even shoot from 10 meters and score, which in real life situation would be an assured goal for any pro player. The Modes are good, but why not make them all accessable for online and crossplay. Champions League should be online and perhaps a weekly competition where players across different consoles. but no, you won't do that and you refuse to make your game better. Player base on PCThis actually really a big problem for PC players. There are not that many, because simply there is no incentive to play the game online at least. There should be more advertising to PC base and more rewards for online competitions. I hope EA takes these constructive criticism and fix these issues. Sincerely,FIFA and Football passionate"

A fun football simulator/arcade game that is very much overpriced when the developers misunderstand content for more skins in a lootbox.Basically no innovation each year, due to a small development window with all the effort poured into their money maker FUT... (can't really blame them for that, money makes the world go around), but their monopolisation over the football licence means that we have no other options if you're craving a football game. If you're looking for a simplified manager mode, then Fifa has that, but don't expect any kind of depth to the gamemode. If you're looking for a complex and engaging manager mode simulator, look at Football Manager Series.Bit of shame that the game requires an origin login, but then again, it has the same thing on the consoles and this is nothing new, with lots of companies building drm logins to combat piracy etc.TldR - If you're expecting a revolutionary football title, you won't find it in Fifa. Until some real competition enters the market, which is difficult when EA own the majority of the football licenses (proven by PES). If you want to try the game before purchasing, I recommend that you use the EA Play trial."

1313860,0,0,7.65612E+16,4,3,1,146.1,"9 October, 2020","I have done nothing but play this game for the last three days and I am happy with it so far. I find that I am really enjoying ultimate team again. Last year I fell out of love with it by November because EA decided to hand things out to people (icons). I think it is going to be a very good year for Fifa, maybe almost good enough to redeem for last years rubbish. In terms of gameplay it is fun. I find that the goalkeepers are better this year however EA need to decrease the likelihood of an across goal shot going in. I would say that some players are still trying to abuse the fast cards and it can be agitating. I personally like to build up some play and then score a good goal. By doing this I find the gameplay comes out more smooth. The transfer market this Fifa is once again all over the place, but not as bad as previous games. I think a good example would be 80 rated Saint-Maximan, he costs $70,000 coins whereas a whole Bundesliga team of 84 and 85 rated cards costs that much. Something that I have seen content creators praise is the fact that we get coins off of our rivals placement matches. I too love it. I think if you can win at least three games which would give you $64,000 coins then you should be happy. It allows us Fifa players to create a usable team from the start. My advice would be to invest this into the advanced SBC's as you will only make a profit. I think EA deserve praise for their improvements. I highly recommend this game.NOTE:If you have any questions just leave a comment and I will answer it when I see it."

This whole FIFA franchise has a lot of issues that needs to be addressed, Let's start with the pros and cons of FIFA 21Pros:- The game is well optimized and runs smoothly, In my case i have a high end PC (RTX 2080/Ryzen 9 3900X) and the game works stable and fine at 1440p@60fps (i limited it at 60fps)- Steam and Origin uses the same server for online play which is good for playerbase- Dribbling is now harder to prevent people from spamming dribbles, And some skill moves are now slower- It's now harder to defend which is a good thing so there will be a skill gap between good/average/newbie players- FUT Improvements: They removed Fitness Cards, CO-OP mode in FUT, You can now play friendlies with your FUT Team, New Menus, Improved Stadium Customizations- Updates comes first on PCCons:- Fast players are so much overpowered this year- Goal keepers are still bad- No story mode this year (Like the story mode Journey that was included in FIFA 17 and FIFA 19- Outdated graphics (feels like a 2014-2016 game)Cons (Of only PC version):- Next-Gen Graphics are not coming to this year's PC version unfortunately, FIFA 21 uses the same version released on PS4 and Xbox One- Origin is required to launch the Steam version, This is the case for most EA games and it's a shame.- the PC version has unfortunately some cheaters, And EA anti-cheat is really bad, All you can do for now when you meet a cheater is to report him to EA- PC Players cannot qualify for competitive esports tournamentsConclusion:- If you are a football fan and you don't mind an arcadey game, You will have a lot of fun with this FIFA- If you are a football fan and you want the best football simulation, Your best bet is to go with PES- If you are a football fan and you want Next-Gen graphics, You either wait for FIFA 22/PES 2022 on PC, Or buy FIFA 21 on PS5/XSX/XSS"

I am still discovering small stuffs like these in every match I play).Also, people having stuttering issues/slow motion into paced gameplay, what I did was changed Fifa setting to lock to 60fps  (other settings set to high/ultra) and in Nvidia control panel, I changed V-Sync setting to be controlled by the 3D application for Fifa and the stuttering stopped and it works like charm now. **This solution may not work for all.**All in all, I am happy with Fifa 21 and enjoying a lot."

1313860,4,0,IvyFtw,258,34,1,672.2,"8 October, 2020","As with every FIFA the game itself is simple enough to pick up and play but this year there is a focus on giving you an array of tools that will allow you to hone your style of play. The hope, we assume, is to make gameplay more varied and metas harder to come by. Inevitably the community will settle on preferred tactics and styles but FIFA 21 allows a more intelligent approach, particularly at an elite level.+ So many modes to play+ Career Mode is decent finally+ Hyper-realistic gameplay+ Volta Football is still a great mode"
